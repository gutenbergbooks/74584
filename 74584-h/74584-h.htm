</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> following pages contain
a comprehensive description of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1905.
This includes revision and amplification of the âHandbook of the
Sudanâ (1898) and of the âSupplement to the Handbook of the Sudanâ
(1899), besides a great deal of additional information as to the
resources, development, administration, commerce, etc., of the
country, shewing its progress since 1899. It may, however, be well
understood that the description of many parts of the country is
still far from complete.</p>

<p>The chapters have been compiled by various officers in the Sudan
Administration; but the main work of editing and revision has
fallen on Lieut.-Colonel Count Gleichen (the Editor), who, from the
somewhat indiscriminate mass of reports, documents and books at his
disposal, has evolved a compendium which cannot fail to be of great
use and value to the officers and officials of the Sudan
Government. I even venture to hope that such of the general public
as may be interested in this vast country, its history, and its
future, will find in the following pages a useful work of reference
until a more complete and comprehensive work is forthcoming.</p>

<p>[The loss to the Sudan Government of the services of Count
Gleichen, who, since he undertook this work, has been transferred
to the Military AttachÃ©ship at Berlin, is much to be regretted, and
that he should have been able to continue the compilation in his
new position speaks volumes for his industry and capacity.]</p>

<p>The Editorâs thanks are particularly due to Sir William Garstin,
G.C.M.G., and Captain Lyons (Director of Egyptian Government
Surveys) for a mass of valuable information about the White Nile,
and to Captain H. H. S. Morant (Assistant Director of
Intelligence), for assistance rendered in compiling and
editing.</p>

<p>The work has been divided into three Parts (Geographical and
Descriptive, Historical, and Routes); the last Part, for
convenience of practical reference, being bound separately (by
chapters) as the second volume.</p>

<p>[For practical purposes of travel, sport, etc., the books noted
on <a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a> will be found indispensable.]</p>

<p class="sch">GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p><a id="p1c01s01"></a><span class=
"sidenote">Boundaries.</span>The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan comprises
that country which is bounded on the north by the 22nd parallel of
north latitude; on the east by the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Abyssinia;
on the west and south-west by a line running through the Libyan
Desert (defined by the Anglo-French Agreement of March, 1899), by
the Sultanate of Wadai, and by the line of rising ground forming
the watershed between the Congo and Shari on one side, and the Nile
on the other; and on the south by the Lado Enclave<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
east of the Nile, the 5th parallel of north latitude.</p>

<p>The greatest length from north to south is about 1,250 miles,
and from east to west about 1,080 miles. (<em>Vide</em> <a href=
"#appa">Appendix A</a> for text of Frontier treaties.)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Area and population.</span>The estimated
area of the territory is about 1,006,000 square miles, and the
population about 2,000,000. For distribution of population
<em>vide</em> Appendix F., <a href="#Page_322">p. 322.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Capital and main towns.</span>The capital
and seat of Government of the country is Khartoum, situated at the
junction of the White and Blue Niles (lat. 15Â° 36â², long. 32Â° 32â²),
and distant, as the crow flies, about 1,250 miles from the
Mediterranean Sea. (For description <em>see</em> Chap. II, <a href=
"#Page_49">p. 49.</a>)</p>

<p>The other chief towns of the country are Khartoum North
(formerly termed Halfaya) and Omdurman (close to Khartoum), Halfa,
Merowe, Berber, Wad Medani, Kassala, Suakin, Dueim, and El Obeid.
(Detailed descriptions will be found in the various chapters
dealing with them.)</p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p>The Sudan is administered by a Governor-General (who is at
present also Sirdar of the Egyptian Army) and under him by Mudirs
(governors of provinces), assisted by inspectors and deputy
inspectors<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> (British: military and civilian), and by Mamurs
(Egyptian or Native officers).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>The text of the
agreement of 1899, on which the administration is based, provides
for the administration of the territory south of the 22nd parallel
of latitude by a Governor-General, appointed by Egypt with the
assent of Great Britain, and declares the general principles in
accordance with which the administration shall be carried on. The
British and Egyptian flags shall be used together; laws shall be
made by proclamation; no duties shall be levied on imports from
Egypt, and duties on imports from other countries shall not exceed
those levied in Egypt; the import and export of slaves is
prohibited, and special attention shall be paid to the Brussels Act
of 1890 respecting the import and export of arms, ammunition, and
spirits.</p>

<p>The âCapitulationsâ are not in force in the Sudan, nor are there
any foreign Consuls.</p>

<p>The Sudan is divided into eight first class and four second
class Provinces, as follows:â</p>

<p>The deficit is made up by the Egyptian Government, which now
contributes annually to the cost of Civil and Military
Administration in the Sudan the nominal sum of about Â£E.380,000.
The actual sum contributed is, however, not really so large as
this, for about Â£E.60,000 is paid in Customs dues in Egypt on goods
going to the Sudan, which sum is absorbed by the Egyptian
Government; and the Sudan Government pays the Egyptian Government
an annual amount of between Â£E.122,000 and Â£E.282,000 (Â£E.186,757
in 1905) for the maintenance of that portion of the army which is
in the Sudan.</p>

<p>Some changes were introduced into the system of accounts in 1903
which caused a considerable increase in the figures on both sides
of the Budget of that year as compared with those for previous
years, but this increase was apparent only and did not affect the
amount of the contribution by the Egyptian Government towards the
Civil and Military expenditure of the Sudan Government.</p>

<p>Besides the above budgetary expenditure, additional credits to
the extent of Â£E.1,060,114 have been authorised since 1899,
principally for completing and improving the railway between Halfa
and Khartoum, for telegraph extensions, public works and for other
purposes. Moreover, the entire cost of the railway now in course of
construction between Suakin on the Red Sea and the Nile at a point
near the Atbara River in the Berber Province, and expenditure
connected with the new harbour works at Sheikh Barghout to the
North of Suakin, will be borne by the Egyptian Government.</p>

derived in certain Provinces from the âUshur,â or tenth part, tax.
This is assessed on the value of the products of the land, and is
paid sometimes in kind, but generally in cash.</p>

<p>The land tax is assessed on the extent and value of the
irrigated land, and varies from 10 piastres to 60 piastres a feddan
(acre). Rain lands pay less than irrigated lands, whilst those only
recently coming under cultivation pay less than those already long
cultivated, etc., etc.</p>

<p class="sch3 less">(<em>See</em> <a href="#p1c10">Chapter X</a>
for details.)</p>

<p>Communication in the Sudan is maintained by:â(I) Railways; (II)
River; (III) Roads.</p>

<p>(I) <span class="sc">The Railway</span>.âThe Sudan Government
Railway, a single line completed on the last day of 1899, runs from
Halfa, crossing the Nubian desert, to Abu Hamed along the Nile bank
to Khartoum North on the right bank of the Blue Nile opposite
Khartoum (575 miles).</p>

<p>Another branch, also single, 203 miles, runs from Halfa to Kerma
(35 miles north of Dongola) following the Nile. This is to be
abandoned after the 31st December, 1904.</p>

<p>A line of railway joining Suakin on the Red Sea to the Nile near
the mouth of the Atbara is now under construction; it will be of
the greatest benefit to the trade and development of the Sudan.
Other railway projects at present under consideration are:âAbu
Hamed to Merowe, Thamiam (near Suakin) to Kassala, and Omdurman to
El Obeid.</p>

<p>The distance between Halfa and Aswan forms the only break in the
railway communication between Khartoum and the Mediterranean Sea; a
service of Sudan steamers plies on this reach.</p>

<p>(II) <span class="sc">River</span>.âNorth of Khartoum the river
is navigable throughout except at the five cataracts; at certain
times of the year most of these are navigable, with difficulty.
South of Khartoum communication is maintained along the White and
Blue Niles and their affluents. During low NileâJanuary to Juneâthe
Blue Nile is not navigable. The White Nile is navigable up to
Gondokoro in Uganda, though there are some difficulties in the way
of navigation (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_73">p. 73</a>). The
Sobat and Baro are not navigable from January to beginning of
May.</p>

<p>(III) <span class="sc">Roads</span>.âRoads are, and must be for
some time to come, the principal means of communication in the
Sudan. Transport is chiefly performed by camels, mules and donkeys.
The greater part of the Sudan, being level, lends itself without
much difficulty to the making of roads suitable for carriages,
though draught transport has not been in use hitherto to any
extent. Bullock wagons are in use in the Bahr El Ghazal.</p>

<p>Some automobile carriages are now being tried in the different
parts of the Sudan, and have so far given fairly good results.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c01s05"></a>RESOURCES AND COMMERCE.</h3>

<p>The chief natural resources of the Sudan at present lie in the
forests of Kordofan and the Blue Nile, which produce gum (Hashab
and Talh), ebony, furniture woods and fibre; and in those of the
Bahr El Ghazal, which produce india-rubber, gutta-percha, etc.;
also in the products of animals, such as ivory, ostrich feathers,
rhinoceros horns, skins, etc.</p>

<p>There are large quantities of fine cattle in the country,
especially on the Upper White Nile, but export of these is for the
present forbidden.</p>

<p>As regards agricultural products, only the country lying close
to the Nile and its tributaries is, as a rule, cultivated, and the
people do not, so far, grow more than is necessary for their own
use. The principal crops are dura (a kind of millet), beans,
lentils, dukhn, sesame, onions, melons, and a little wheat and
barley. In the Gezira, however, between the White and Blue Niles,
and in the Gedaref district, large tracts are cultivated.</p>

<p>The Dongola Province is rich in date palms, and exports large
quantities of dates.</p>

<p>There is a large opening for the growth and export of cotton.
Little is grown at present, but the soil is favourable and the
quality is good. Inducements, therefore, in the way of seed and
promises to purchase what is grown, are being offered to the
natives to cultivate this invaluable plant, and it is expected that
the opening of the Nile-Red Sea Railway will considerably increase
its production.</p>

<p>Sugar could also be grown: there was formerly a sugar factory at
Kamlin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Land and settlement.</span>The fertility
of the land in the Sudan varies enormously, from the sterile desert
wastes of Northern Kordofan and the Eastern Sudan to the rich soil
bordering the river banks. There are also large tracts of fertile
soil round Gedaref, Kassala and Tokar, where rich crops are grown
with little effort.</p>

<p>Inducements are, according to circumstances, held out by the
Government to would-be settlers in the shape of free or easy grants
of lands, remission of taxes for a time, low rates of transport,
etc., and purchasers and cultivators are slowly trickling in. The
settlement, especially in view of the dearth of native population
and labour, must necessarily be a slow one. As larger tracts are
brought into cultivation, as canals are dug, and as irrigation and
communications are improved, so will the export of cereals and
produce of all sorts increase. The Nile-Red Sea Railway is expected
to give Sudan trade a great impetus, and the population is rapidly
increasing. But although those best qualified to judge are
convinced of a great economic future before the country, it can
hardly be expected that the Sudan will pay its own way for some
years to come.</p>

<p>The native industries are, so far, limited in number.
Cultivation is the usual occupation of the people. Cotton-cloth
weaving, boat-building on the Niles, camel breeding in the northern
and western deserts, and iron-smelting in the Bahr El Ghazal
practically exhaust the list. Agricultural and industrial shows at
the chief towns have, however, been started, and receive
considerable support. Minor industries, such as pottery, leather
work, improved carpentry, etc., are quickly coming to the fore.</p>

<h3>CUSTOMS DUTIES.</h3>

<p>For the purpose of Customs duties, the Sudan is, in the main,
considered as forming a part of Egypt. The Government has, however,
concluded a Customs Convention with Eritrea,<a id=
"FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and applies practically the same principles to the co-terminous
countries of Uganda, the Congo Free State, the French Congo and
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Broadly, goods exported to these countries from the Sudan pay 1
per cent. <em>ad valorem</em>, and imports from those countries 5
to 8 per cent.; whilst goods in transit thence receive a drawback
equal in amount to the duty paid on entering the country,
<em>i.e.</em>, they can pass free of duty through the Sudan.<a id=
"FNanchor_11b"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h3><a id="p1c01s06"></a>JUSTICE.</h3>

<p>The main lines of judicial organisation in the Sudan date from
1899, at which time the whole country was under Egyptian Martial
Law.</p>

<p>Under the code of Criminal Procedure of that year the criminal
courts are directly under the Governor-General, who, however, has
the benefit of the advice of a Legal Secretary. Under âThe Civil
Justice Ordinance, 1900,â the civil courts are subordinated to the
Legal Secretary, in his capacity as Acting Judicial
Commissioner.</p>

<p>Criminal justice in each province is administered by the Mudirâs
Court (composed of the Mudir or Governor, or his representative,
and two other magistrates), which has general competence; minor
District Courts of three officers, with limited competence; and
magistrates with powers similar to, but more limited than, those of
Indian Magistrates. These magistrates are the members of the
Provincial Administrative Staff, who are either picked officers of
the army or civilian inspectors, who, unless they have had a legal
training, are required to pass an examination in the Codes.</p>

<p>The procedure at the inquiry, and as to arrest, etc., is
borrowed from the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure; that at the
hearing is that of an Egyptian (or substantially, of a British)
court-martial, with which the military officers are familiar.</p>

<p>Sentences passed by the Mudirâs Court are submitted to the
Governor-General for confirmation. Those of the subordinate courts
are either submitted to the Mudir for confirmation, or are open to
appeal before him.</p>

<p>The Governor-General has, in all cases, revising powers similar
to those of an Indian High Court.</p>

<p>The substantive criminal law is contained in the Sudan Penal
Code, which is a copy of the Indian Penal Code, with such
modifications as the circumstances of the country appeared to
demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>The civil courts
in each province are those of the Mudir and of the subordinate
magistrates. The procedure is borrowed in part from that in Indian
provinces which do not possess a High Court, and in part from the
Ottoman and African Orders in Council.</p>

<p>The parties appear before the judge, who settles the issues to
be tried before trying the case. Every court has power to sit with
assessors, who, in commercial cases, are frequently of considerable
assistance. Appeals lie to the Mudir, or from the court of the
Mudir to that of the Judicial Commissioner.</p>

<p>This system has been somewhat modified by the appointment of
four civil judges who are trained lawyers. Wherever there is a
civil judge, he has all the powers, civil and criminal, of the
Mudir, and ordinarily takes all the civil and the more responsible
criminal work of that officer. A civil judge has now sat
continuously for the last three years at Khartoum, where all the
principal merchants reside. A system of circuits will probably be
shortly instituted in the outlying provinces; in the meantime
provision is made for civil disputes of special importance or
complexity in those provinces by a section which authorises their
transfer, by consent of the parties, to the court of the Judicial
Commissioner. It is very possible that the latter court may shortly
be replaced by a bench of civil judges.</p>

<p>It was not thought advisable to create a body of substantive
civil law at a time when all that was known of the customs of the
people was that they probably differed from those of any country
whose legislation could have been taken as a precedent. Section 3
of the Civil Justice Ordinance provides for the recognition of
customary law, so far as applicable and not repugnant to good
conscience, in matters of succession, etc.; and Section 4 provides
for the administration of âjustice, equity, and good conscience,â a
phrase which has stereotyped custom in large parts of the east, and
filled up the interstices with the principles of English Law.</p>

<p>In commercial matters in the Sudan the judges have inclined to
interpret it as implying the obligation to recognise the principles
of Egyptian Commercial Law in cases in which the law of civilised
countries is not in agreement.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Codes are applied wherever they may be put
in force by the Governor-General, and they have been gradually
extended to all parts of the Sudan, except the Bahr El Ghazal. In
the more backward provinces in the south, where officers are
scattered, advantage has to be taken of a provision that they shall
be applied with such modifications, not affecting the substance, as
the circumstances may require.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mehkema Sharia.</span>There are special
courts, Mehkema Sharia, for the trial in accordance with Mohammedan
Law, of cases between Mohammedans, involving questions of personal
status, such as succession, wills, gifts, marriage, divorce, family
relations, and also the constitution of charitable endowments
(wakf).</p>

<p>The judges of these courts are Mohammedan Sheikhs, either
natives of the Sudan or Egyptians; of whom the latter have obtained
their training in the Azhar Mosque at Cairo.</p>

<p>The Mehkema Sharia comprise District Courts, which have
jurisdiction over one or more Districts, according to the extent
and population of the Districts, Province Courts, which act as
courts of appeal from the District Courts and have also an original
jurisdiction over the district in which they are situated, and a
Supreme Court of Appeal situated at Khartoum, consisting of the
Grand Kadi of the Sudan, who acts as President, the Mufti, and two
judges of appeal.</p>

<p>Though the majority of the inhabitants of the Sudan are
followers of the Maliki School of Mohammedan Law, the courts
generally, as in Egypt, adopt the jurisprudence of the Hanafi
School.</p>

<h3>LEGISLATION.</h3>

<p>Legislation takes the form of Ordinances, issued by proclamation
of the Governor-General. In accordance with Article IV of the
Agreement of the 19th January, 1899, between the British and
Egyptian Government as to the administration of the Sudan, all such
ordinances must be forthwith notified to the British Agent-General
in Cairo and the President of the Council of Ministers of His
Highness the Khedive. All Ordinances are published in the âSudan
Gazette.â</p>

<h3><a id="p1c01s07"></a>RELIGION.</h3>

<p>Except for the negroid tribes the religion of the native
population is that of Islam. The black tribes in their own country
are all heathen; outside it a good many of their members have
embraced Islam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The Arab
population is inclined to be fanatical; and to enable the
Government to keep itself informed of the religious feelings of the
people, a consultory board of Ulema (learned men) has been
established at Omdurman.</p>

<p>There are two Christian missionary stations amongst the black
tribes: one (American Protestant) on the Sobat River, and the other
(Austrian Roman Catholic) near Kodok. The latter mission is now
establishing another branch in the Bahr El Ghazal.</p>

<p>There are also several missionary schools at Khartoum and
Omdurman. A British Protestant Church is about to be built at
Khartoum, and there are Roman Catholic, Greek, and Coptic churches
in course of construction.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c01s08"></a>EDUCATION.</h3>

<p>In the Sudan a higher primary school system is gradually being
developed. There are four of these schools (Khartoum, Omdurman,
Halfa, and Suakin), besides a few Kuttab or village schools, where
instruction is given in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Every day
shows a greater necessity for a Sudanese class able to read, write,
and cipher sufficiently to fill the minor appointments under
Government. This class is gradually being constructed, but it takes
time, especially as competent teachers are scarce.</p>

<p>All school subjects are taught in Arabic, not English. The
latter language is not encouraged, but it can be taught, as a
foreign language.</p>

<p>The Gordon College, with an endowment of over Â£E.100,000, was
finished and opened in October, 1903.</p>

<p>At present it contains a Higher Primary School, attended by 150
boys, and a Training College for Schoolmasters and Kadis. Competent
Sudanese teachers of the vernacular are now the chief requirement,
but this want will be remedied as time goes on.</p>

<p>A separate wing of the building affords room for an institute
for bacteriological work,<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and research into the
products and diseases of the country.</p>

<p>Another invaluable adjunct to the College is found in some
technical workshops generously and completely fitted up by a
private benefactor.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h3>CLIMATE.</h3>

<p>The climate of the Sudan naturally varies over such a huge
territory. Roughly speaking, it may be said that from the latitude
of about Shendi northwards the climate is dry throughout the year.
South of this, the rains in the summer, increasing in intensity
towards the south, towards the sea, and towards the Abyssinian
hills, cause a damp climate for two or three months, the remaining
months being quite dry.</p>

<p>Between Halfa and Dongola there are a few rainy days in the
winter, and, very exceptionally, some torrential rains in the
summer. At Suakin heavy rains occur at intervals from August to
January, with occasional rainfalls during the spring. The Khor
Baraka flood may be expected at Tokar about the 15th August, and
the Gash flood at Kassala during the first week of July.</p>

<p>The rainy season proper, on the Upper Blue Nile, Atbara, and in
Abyssinia commences about the middle or end of May, the rains
lasting till the middle of September; light rains in January and
February; heavy rains sometimes in October and November.</p>

<p>The rainy season at Khartoum and in the âBayuda desertâ lasts
nominally from the middle of June to the end of September, but
during this period rain rarely falls on more than 15 days. In the
Bahr El Ghazal the rains last from April till October, and in
Southern Kordofan and Darfur from June to October.</p>

<p>Heavy rains occur in addition in the valley of the Upper White
Nile from September to November; also numerous thunderstorms,
especially in the hilly region round Rejaf and the Sudd district to
the north of it.</p>

<p>On the Sobat, rains last from May to end of October.</p>

<p>The more unhealthy parts, in each case only during the period
immediately succeeding the rains or the Nile flood, are, in the
order of the evil, the Bahr El Ghazal, the Upper White Nile, the
Upper Blue Nile, Kordofan, Kassala, and Suakin. During the rest of
the year the climate is dry and healthy throughout. The temperature
is, in the summer, undoubtedly hot, the thermometer having on rare
occasions risen to as much as 126Â°; but on the other hand, except
in the rainy season, the nights are always cool and refreshing.</p>

<p>During the rest of the year, the temperature naturally varies
considerably; but it may be said that the winter is bright and
invigorating throughout, and not too hot. There are even
unpleasantly cold winds at times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Except during the
rainy season, the prevailing winds are, in the valley of the Nile,
always from a northerly direction. In other parts, the wind varies
according to season, but all get their share of the north wind.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c01s09"></a>GAME.</h3>

<p>The efforts of the Government are directed towards preserving
the numerous species of game of all sorts which abound in the
Sudan, and to preventing them being exploited wholesale for
commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Thus the Government, in the matter of ivory and feathers, has
laid down stringent regulations which control the killing of
elephants and ostriches. By imposing heavy duties and strictly
limiting the numbers it is keeping within reasonable limits the
export of live animals for menageries, etc., in Europe; and traffic
in skins, trophies, etc., of wild animals is strictly
prohibited.</p>

<p>As regards the shooting of game for sport, a sanctuary and game
reserve have been instituted, and the licence with which a
sportsman has to provide himself is expensive and only covers the
shooting of a limited number of each species, some species being
tabooed altogether. (For full details of the Game Laws,
<em>vide</em> Ordinance for Preservation of Wild Animals, etc.,
1903, and for practical hints, etc., <em>re</em> shooting,
<em>see</em> books mentioned on <a href="#Page_213">p.
213.</a>)</p>

<h3>SLAVERY.</h3>

<p>Slave-running is practically dead, save perhaps in the remotest
parts of the Sudan. The Egyptian Repression of Slavery Department
is well represented by a number of posts dotted about in the
regions most likely to be favourable to this traffic.</p>

<h3>FORESTS.</h3>

<p>In the Sudan, north of Khartoum, forests are scarce and of
little extent. Scattered trees of âSamrâ (<i>Acacia tortilis</i>)
reach right into the desert, while on the occasionally flooded
âKaruâ land, between the desert and cultivation, is an open growth
of the above with âSelemâ (<i>Acacia Ehrenbergii</i>), âSayalâ
(<i>Acacia spirocarpa</i>), âHashabâ (<i>Acacia Verek</i>),
âTundubâ (<i>Capparis aphylla</i>), âMarakhâ (<i>Leptadenia
Spartium</i>), etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>South of Khartoum
till about parallel 12Â° N. the forests consist mostly of belts,
usually not of very great width, lining the banks of the rivers and
khors. In these belts the most valuable tree is the âSantâ or
âSuntâ (<i>Acacia arabica</i>), known not only for the strength of
its wood, but for the tanning properties of its bark and seed pod,
and also for its excellence as fuel, as well as for its value for
boat building.</p>

<p>Inland, there are open woods of âHegligâ (<i>Balanites
Ã¦gyptiaca</i>), âTalh,â and âHashab,â or dense thickets of âKittrâ
(<i>Acacia mellifera</i>) and âLaotâ (<i>Acacia nubica</i>).</p>

<p>It is in this zone that the open woods of âHashabâ (<i>Acacia
verek</i>), in Kordofan, are carefully tended and preserved against
fire for the sake of their gum which is exported as âHashab
Geneinaâ; the gum from the unprotected forests fetching a lower
price as âHashab Gezira,â or âGezira,â while that from other
acacias is known as âTalh,â as the Talh tree is the chief
producer.</p>

<p>South of 12Â° N., where the rainfall is more abundant, the forest
on the White Nile is, as far as the northern limits of the Sudd, of
similar character, only large tracts have been cleared near the
river by the Shilluks, and Sant has completely disappeared and is
not replaced by trees of equivalent value.</p>

<p>On the Blue Nile the forest changes in character. Not far from
the river are numerous gigantic Baobabs (âTebeldi,â <i>Adansonia
digitata</i>) and âTarfaâ (<i>Sterculia cinerea</i>), while the
most abundant trees are the graceful âSilagâ (<i>Anogeissus
leiocarpus</i>) and the Sudan ebony (âBabanus,â <i>Dalbergia
melanoxylon</i>).</p>

<p>In these two species, as well as in some others, these forests
are like those on the higher lands of the Bahr El Ghazal province
and parts of Southern Kordofan. The Bahr El Ghazal forests cover
the larger portion of the ironstone deposits in that province, and,
as far as quality goes, are probably the finest found in the Sudan,
many trees of great height and girth being found there, one of
them, the African mahogany (âHomraya,â <i>Khaya senegalensis</i>),
having a beautiful timber, already known to commerce. It is in
these forests that rubber-producing lianas are most abundant, the
best of them being âNdalaâ or âOdiloâ (<i>Landolphia
owariensis</i>), <em>vide</em> <a href="#p1c07">Chapter
VII.</a></p>

<p>The forests on the Bahr El Jebel and the woodlands of the Bahr
El Ghazal province are more like those on the Upper White Nile, but
some other trees appear, and the forests are not only in belts, but
cover large areas. Near Mongalla the ironstone appears, and the
forests partake of the same character as those of the Upper Bahr El
Ghazal.</p>

<p>The forests on the Abyssinian and Eritrean frontiers have not
yet been explored by an expert.</p>

<p>All over the Sudan the forests suffer greatly from fires which
are set alight by the natives either for purposes of sport, or to
clear the paths, or for grazing after the rains. Owing to these
fires numbers of trees get killed or mutilated, and it is hopeless
to think of developing fine forests until they can be kept under
control.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fuel.</span>One of the great economic
questions of the Sudan, which gives rise to a certain anxiety, is
the future supply of fuel. Although the felling of trees is under
control, those alongside the river necessarily suffer greatly from
the demand for steamer fuel, and there is not an unlimited supply.
So far, no coal or petroleum has been found in the Sudan; it is
believed that there are beds of lignite in the Dongola Province,
but up till now they have not been thoroughly explored. Imported
coal now costs from Â£E.4 to Â£E.6, and petroleum Â£E.6, a ton at
Khartoum. (<em>Vide</em> also <a href="#Page_20">p. 20.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Concessions.</span>A certain part of the
Sudanâchiefly to the north and north-east and south-eastâhas been
leased to concessionaires for the purpose of prospecting for
minerals and exploiting them when found. There are traces of gold
and other minerals in most of these areas.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Survey.</span>The Sudan is being surveyed
(commenced in 1898) on a scale of <span class=
"fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class=
"denominator">250000</span></span>. So far, over 50 sheets out of
139 projected have been published, and the work of surveying is
proceeding steadily. <em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_349">p.
349.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sanitary.</span>The population is very
gradually being trained in sanitary methods, but it is a slow
process. Efforts are also being made to stamp out malaria,<a id=
"FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
etc., by the latest scientific methods, but the size of most of the
malarial districts is vastly in excess of the means so far
available to deal with them. At Khartoum and at some of the other
chief towns the steps taken have proved most effectual.</p>

Nile,â F.O. Bluebook, Egypt No.</em> 2 (1904). <em>Price</em>
17<em>s.</em>]</p>

<h3><a id="p1c02a"></a>(i.)âINTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>The White Nile and its
tributaries form the life blood of the Sudan. The great river
traverses it for 2,029 miles from south to north, receiving on its
course through the country the Bahr El Ghazal, the Sobat, the Blue
Nile, and the Atbara.</p>

<p>Of these four tributaries the Bahr El Ghazal joins the Nile out
of the swamps from the west, whilst the other three join it from
the east, bringing down the fertilizing matter from the Abyssinian
hills.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Flood.</span>The rise of the Nile takes
place during the summer, but the dates naturally vary largely at
different points.</p>

<p>The causes of the flood are, briefly, as follows:âThe rains in
southern Abyssinia cause the Sobat to rise about the middle or end
of April. The yellowish-white water caused by this flood reaches
Kodok the last week in April. The equatorial rains cause the Bahr
El Zeraf and White Nile, above the Sobat, to rise about the end of
May. The effect of the first rise is felt at Halfa about the 20th
May. The Blue Nile begins to rise about this time, and brings the
red fertilizing flood down to Khartoum about the 20th June, and to
Halfa about the middle of July. The muddy Atbara flood (June to
August) rises very rapidly after the Blue Nile, and causes the
flood to attain its maximum about the end of August; at this period
the river is muddiest. The White Nile continues to rise slowly, and
its effects (clear white water) are felt at Halfa till October,
when it falls very slowly. The Blue Nile falls rapidly after the
middle of September, and the Atbara has generally disappeared by
October. The Sobat begins to fall at Nasser early in December.</p>

<p>The Bahr El Ghazal rivers rise slightly in May. These soon
subside, and the main floods take place in July and August.</p>

<p>The above is a description of an average year. An early maximum
(<em>i.e.</em>, about the middle of August) generally means a low
summer flood, and <em>vice versÃ¢</em>. The flood at its height
moves at about 100 miles a day (below the Atbara).<a id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The above dates vary largely in accordance with the time and
amount of rainfall in the upper valleys of the rivers.</p>

<p>Of the flood water annually brought down by the rivers, about
half now runs to waste into the Mediterranean sea. The Aswan dam
regulates and utilizes this to a certain extent, but a large
proportion remains over. This it is proposed to utilize in the
future for irrigating the Sudan by means of flood and catchment
basins; but the time is still distant when this surplus will be
entirely devoted to this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Historical.</span>Up to comparatively
recent times the sources of the Nile were involved in
mystery.<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> In ancient days many guesses were hazarded at
their origin, some geographers maintaining that the Nile rose in
the Atlas Mountains of Marocco; others were positive that the Niger
formed the upper portion of the great river. During the 17th and
18th centuries it was held that the sources were to be found in the
âMountains of the Moon.â These have since been speculatively
identified with the Ruwenzori Mountains between Lakes Albert and
Albert Edward, and, if this theory is correct, the ancient
geographers were not so far out.</p>

<p>It was left for Speke and Grant, in 1862, on a journey from the
east coast, to discover that the great lake, now known as the
Victoria Nyanza, was the main source of the White Nile. Sir Samuel
Baker, in March, 1863, working up stream, discovered the Albert
Nyanza; but it was not till some time afterwards that the actual
course of that portion of the river, now known as the Bahr El
Jebel, was mapped and traversed, Lieutenants Watson and
Chippendall, R.E., being the first, under Gordon in 1874, to lay
down the actual course. During the ensuing years, this, the upper
portion of the river, was several times blocked with sudd, and at
the re-conquest of the Sudan from the Dervishes in 1898, it was
permanently blocked. An expedition under Major Peake, however,
succeeded in clearing a channel in 1899-1900, and there is no
likelihood of the clear channel now existing being, except quite
temporarily, blocked again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>The sources of the
Blue Nile, which for long was considered as the main river, were,
as early as 1770, discovered by Bruce to be near Lake Tsana
(Abyssinia), but to this day the actual course of the Blue Nile
between Lake Tsana and Famaka (Abyssinian-Sudan border) has never
been accurately laid down.</p>

<p>The course of the Atbara, as far up as the junction with it of
the Setit, was roughly known before 1864, when Sir S. Baker made a
more thorough exploration of these rivers, but the courses of the
Atbara and Setit lying within the Sudan have only recently been
fairly accurately laid down. The Atbara rises in the Abyssinian
hills, near Chelga, where it is known as the Goang.</p>

<p>The Sobat was explored by Marno and Junker in the âSeventiesâ as
far as Nasser, where there was then an Egyptian post. It was left
for British officers, after 1898, headed by Captain Gamble, to
explore the various narrow rivers such as the Baro, Pibor, Akobo,
etc., which join the main stream from South-West Abyssinia, east of
Nasser. The course of the Upper Pibor was explored by Lieut. Comyn
in September, 1904, <em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_151">p.
151.</a></p>

<p>The course of the comparatively short Bahr El Ghazal river,
known to the slave-traders of old times, was laid down by
Petherick, Gessi, etc., in 1864-78; but the courses of the western
rivers which flow into it, such as the Bahr El Arab<a id=
"FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
or El Homr, have not yet been even roughly determined. Those of the
more southerly affluents, such as the Suei or Jur, etc., though not
yet accurately fixed, have been sketched in by Junker, Marchand,
etc., and the British officers in the Bahr El Ghazal since
1900.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c02b"></a>(ii.)âGENERAL DESCRIPTION (DOWN
STREAM).</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Albert Nyanza to Khartoum, Bahr el
Jebel.</span>After leaving the Albert Nyanza, the White Nile (or as
it is there called the Bahr El Jebel) flows for 110 miles in a deep
broad arm, with scarcely any velocity or slope, past Wadelai and
Dufile to Nimule, and then, after a short and troubled course,
between high mountain ranges, tosses over the Fola Rapids in a
channel only 50 yards broad. From here it continues in a torrent to
about Rejaf. Here the river is 7 feet deep at low Nile and 15 feet
at flood time, discharging between 18,000 to 60,000 cubic feet per
second. The regulating effects of the great lakes are well felt
here. It is here at its lowest in winter; begins to rise about 15th
April, with a minimum about the end of August.</p>

<p>From Rejaf to Bor, 112 miles, the river is mainly in one channel
with a rapid fall. From Bor to the junction with Lake No, 384
miles, the river meanders along in numerous marshy channels with a
very gentle slope. The main channel always used is known as the
Bahr El Jebel. In this reach are the dams of living vegetation,
known as the âSuddâ (for description <em>see</em> <a href=
"#appb">Appendix B</a>). On one stretch the true channel is still
blocked with sudd, and a âfalseâ channel, a little to the
westwards, has to be used for about 20 miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lake No.</span>At the junction of the
Bahr El Ghazal and the Nile in north lat. 9Â° 29â² is Lake No, or
Moghren El Buhur,<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a shallow expanse of water surrounded on
all sides by reedy marsh and varying in size according to season,
but in summer probably about 60 square miles. It forms a reservoir
for the sluggish streams that drain the extensive plateau forming
the water-shed between the Nile and Congo. In summer the lake and
its swampy surroundings act as an evaporating basin, and the loss
of water is consequently considerable. The waters here also become
polluted with decaying green vegetable matter.</p>

<p>The Bahr El Ghazal enters Lake No at its western extremity, and
the Bahr El Jebel passes through its eastern end. The Bahr El
Ghazal has a feeble discharge and has no effect at any time on the
volume of the White Nile.</p>

<p>In the stretch between Lake No and the Sobat, 81 miles, the
current is slow and the channel occasionally blocked by sudd.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sobat.</span>During flood, the Sobat has
a discharge nearly equal to that of the Bahr El Jebel above the
junction. In the spring the discharge from the Sobat is feeble, and
the river is then unnavigable. The soil brought down by the Sobat
is light and friable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">White Nile.</span>At the Sobat confluence
the river changes its name<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and now becomes the Bahr
El Abiad or White Nile.</p>

<p>From this point down to Omdurman, 530 miles, it receives no more
perennial affluents, but several large khors join it on the east
bank between Kodok and Renkâchief of which are Khor Adar and Khor
Rau.</p>

<p>The White Nile flows sluggishly along with a low velocity and
gentle slope; its course is generally straight and its section wide
and shallow, banks low, supply very constant; the colour and
limpidity of its water show very little change throughout the year,
and the variations between the level of high and low supply are
very small, being not more than 2 to 6 feet. The depth of the river
in this stretch ranges from 15 feet at low Nile to 21 feet in
flood. In parts, the channel in flood time is often of immense
width.</p>

<p>The result of 94 measurements made in June, 1862, show the mean
width of the river in flood to be 1,870 yards. In many places,
however, the channel is more than 2 miles wide, and in its general
appearance it resembles a lake rather<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_17">[17]</span> than a river. Its banks, more particularly
the western shore, are very low, and its waters in flood spread for
several miles over them. Their average height is not more than 8 to
10 feet above low water level, and the maximum difference between
high and low supply is not more than 6 feet.</p>

<p>The river is at its lowest by the beginning or middle of April;
the rainfall in the south then causes a constant and gradual rise,
but the flood does not reach its maximum before the beginning of
September.</p>

<p>The velocity of the current when in full flood is not more than
2Â½ to 3 miles an hour, whilst in winter this is reduced to 1Â½ miles
an hour. The water is of an olive green or yellowish brown tinge.
It owes most of its colour to the creamy-white waters of the Sobat
River, called by the Arabs the Bahr El Asfar, or Yellow River.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Green water.</span>An odd phenomenon, the
source of which has not been satisfactorily explained, is the
âgreen water,â which makes its appearance at Dueim about the middle
of May. The colour is owing to the mass of minute algÃ¦ in the
water, which subsequently putrify and stink, but the origin of the
water has not been definitely traced. It is believed to come from
the upper Sobat, or Bahr El Ghazal, and not from the Bahr El Jebel.
This green water reaches Cairo towards the end of June.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Junction of the Niles at
Khartoum.</span>At Omdurman, half Nile usually occurs about the
middle of July, high Nile at end of August or beginning of
September, lasting about a month; half Nile end of November, lowest
Nile end of April. The Blue Nile is at its lowest in May, and
highest about the end of August. The result of careful measurements
during the last 3 years has been to prove that when the Blue Nile
is in flood, and generally when its discharge exceeds 5,000 metres
cube per second, its waters hold back those of the White Nile and,
owing to the increased depth in this river, due to the rise in the
water levels, the volume coming from the south floods the Sudd
marshes right and left of the channel and thus reduces the
discharge of the White Nile by about 50 per cent.</p>

<p>The average difference between low and high Nile here is 22 feet
(17Â½ to 26 feet).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Below Khartoum.</span>The river below
Khartoum flows steadily along till it reaches the 6th or Shabluka
cataract (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>). Below this it
is not disturbed, except for the rapids of the so-called 5th or El
Homar and Bagara cataracts, till it passes Abu Hamed and enters the
4th or Belal cataract some way below this point. This cataract,
forming the most complicated and dangerous rapids on the Nile, is
for ordinary purposes unnavigable (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_36">p. 36</a>). Below it there is an open stretch past
Dongola to the 3rd or Hannek cataract, shortly followed by the
Kajbar rapids (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>). A rocky
channel full of small islands and small rapids, increasing in size
and importance as the river proceeds, is entered some 80 miles
below Kajbar, and through the Batn El Hagar the river rumbles along
till, after passing the 2nd or Amka cataract, it emerges past Halfa
in a broad and steady stream which lasts till it arrives at the dam
and 1st cataract (Shellal) of Aswan. From here onwards there are no
further obstacles (except sand-banks and canals) till, <em>viÃ¢</em>
the Delta of Egypt, the Mediterranean Sea is gained.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c02c"></a>(iii.)âRIVER DISCHARGES.</h3>

<p>The following, taken from Sir W. Garstinâs Report above
mentioned, gives a summary of results respecting discharges in the
basin of the Upper Nile:â</p>

<h4>1. <span class="sc">The Victoria Nile</span>.</h4>

<p>The discharge at the Ripon Falls varies between 500 and 650
metres cube per second with a range of 1Â·1 metres. Downstream of
the Murchison Falls the range is probably 1 metre, and the maximum
and minimum discharges 1,000 and 400 metres cube per second
respectively. The increase in flood is due to the rainfall
throughout the catchment area of the river between these two
points, while the decrease during the low season is due to the
Choga Lake, which undoubtedly has a regulating effect upon the
supply issuing from Lake Victoria. Lastly, the volume which enters
Lake Albert by this river is generally, in flood, greater than that
which leaves it by the Bahr El Jebel.</p>

<h4>2. <span class="sc">The Bahr El Jebel</span>.</h4>

<p>At Wadelai, the first discharge site, the range of the river is
about 1Â·11 metres while the discharge varies from 550 to 950 metres
cube per second. The increase brought in by the streams which feed
this river between Lake Albert and Wadelai is compensated by the
loss of water due to a portion of the discharge of the Victoria
Nile passing south up the lake during the flood season.</p>

<p>At Lado, 381 kilometres, the range is 2Â·30 metres, and the
discharge in summer averages from 600 to 700 metres cube per
second. The maximum (generally attained in September) varies
between 1,000 metres cube per second in a low flood, and 2,000
metres cube per second in a high one. This increase in the flood
supply is due to the rainfall throughout the river valley, and to
the volume added by the many important tributaries, such as the
Asua, the Kit, etc., which feed the Bahr El Jebel between Wadelai
and Lado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>At Bor, 559
kilometres, the loss of water in flood is some 50 per cent. of the
amount passing Lado, and the discharge here can rarely, if ever,
exceed 1,000 metres cube per second. This loss is due to the
filling up of the entire river valley, which thus forms an immense
basin or reservoir, and reduces the discharge passing to the north.
This reservoir extends from Lado to the head of the Bahr El Zeraf,
a distance of some 378 kilometres. As the river falls the water of
this basin, with the exception of the large amount lost by
evaporation, slowly filters back through the marshes into the river
during the winter months, and thus maintains the constancy of
supply.</p>

<p>Throughout the âSuddâ region the loss of water in the Bahr El
Jebel, both in summer and in flood, is very considerable. By the
time that Lake No (1,156 kilometres from Lake Albert, and 749
kilometres from Lado) is reached, 85 per cent. of the discharge at
Lado has been lost in a high flood, and 70 per cent. in a low one.
During the summer months the loss at this point varies between 50
and 60 per cent. Lastly, the discharge which enters the White Nile
from the Bahr El Jebel is nearly constant at all seasons of the
year, and never even in the highest flood exceeds 300 or 320 metres
cube per second. The regulating effect of the great marshes is thus
very apparent.</p>

<h4>3. <span class="sc">The Bahr El Ghazal</span>.</h4>

<p>The discharge of this river, as a feeder of the White Nile, may
be neglected entirely. Its summer volume entering Lake No varies
from 20 to 30 metres cube per second, while its flood discharge is
even less, equalling from 12 to 20 metres cube per second. None of
this water enters the White Nile, merely increasing the flooded
area of Lake No. It, however, helps to augment the reservoir area
of the main stream.</p>

<h4>4. <span class="sc">The Bahr El Zeraf</span>.</h4>

<p>This branch of the Bahr El Jebel adds to the volume of the White
Nile by an amount varying from 30 to 60 metres cube per second in
summer, and from 80 to 160 metres cube per second when in flood.
If, however, the Bahr El Jebel is closed by âSuddâ then the
discharge of the Bahr El Zaraf increases, possibly to from 300 to
400 metres cube per second during the flood season.</p>

<h4>5. <span class="sc">The Sobat</span>.</h4>

<p>This river is the main supply of the White Nile during the
period of flood. The first effects of its waters are felt in May
and June, while, as it does not reach its maximum until October and
November, the volume of the Blue Nile having then been largely
reduced, it maintains the discharge passing Khartoum to a very
considerable figure. In years of good flood the discharge of the
Sobat varies from 900 to 1,000 metres cube per second. In the early
months of the year its discharge shrinks to very low limits, its
waters being held back by those of the White Nile. When in flood
the reverse is the case. The volume of the Sobat being at that time
more than double that of the White Nile causes a rise in the levels
of the latter upstream of the junction and holds back its water as
far as Lake No.</p>

<h4>6. <span class="sc">The White Nile</span>.</h4>

<p>The discharge of this river below the Bahr El Zeraf junction
varies from 300 to 500 metres cube per second according to the
season of the year and the nature of the flood. It is probable that
the last figure is a maximum and is never surpassed.<a id=
"FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
At El Dueim, 637 kilometres below the Sobat junction, the summer
supply varies between 350 and 500 metres cube per second. The
minimum levels are generally attained in the month of April and the
first half of May. The discharge, owing to the Sobat water,
gradually increases until the Blue Nile flood exceeds the volume of
5,000 metres cube per second at Khartoum. As soon as this figure is
passed the discharge of the White Nile is reduced by an amount
varying from 30 to 60 per cent., and this holding back continues
until the Blue Nile falls again below the figure above given. This
reduction of the White Nile discharge takes place in the months of
August and September. As soon as the Blue Nile discharge has fallen
below 5,000 metres cube per second that of the White Nile rises
very rapidly, attaining its maximum in the months of November and
December, when as much as from 1,500 to 1,700 metres cube per
second have been recorded. This increased discharge is, of course,
partly due to the Sobat, but also to the draining off of the water
which has been ponded up for so long a period. It seems safe to
assume that the White Nile discharge at Khartoum never under any
circumstances exceeds 1,800 cubic metres per second.</p>

<p>To sum up:âThe White Nile is at its lowest from March to May. It
rises in June, is checked again in August and September, and
attains its maximum during the months of November and December. Its
limits in a low year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
are from 300 to 1,500 metres cube per second, and in one of high
flood from 400 or 500 to 1,700 metres cube per second.<a id=
"FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<h4>7. <span class="sc">The Blue Nile</span>.</h4>

<p>The supply of this river is chiefly derived from the drainage of
the basin through which it runs and from the large tributaries
which enter it downstream of the point where it issues from the
Abyssinian hills. The Tsana lake has but a small influence upon its
supply at any period of the year. It is at its lowest in May, when
its discharge at times shrinks to nothing. It begins to rise in
June and attains its maximum about the end of August. Its discharge
in a year of good flood is as much as 10,000 metres cube per
second, and it seems probable that in a year of exceptional flood
12,000 metres cube may pass Khartoum. In September it falls very
rapidly, and during the winter months rarely discharges more than
from 200 to 400 metres cube per second. The Khartoum gauges prove
that a higher reading is recorded for a given flood discharge when
the river is falling than is the case when the river is rising.
This is probably due to the filling of the valley between Khartoum
and the Shabluka Pass.</p>

<h4>8. <span class="sc">The Atbara</span>.</h4>

<p>The first water from this river reaches the Nile in the last
week of June, and the maximum is usually reached in the last days
of August, or in the first week of September. The Atbara generally
attains its maximum before the full flood from Khartoum has arrived
at the junction of the two rivers. After the maximum has been
reached, the fall of the Atbara is rapid, and by the end of the
year the river reverts to its summer state of a series of pools.
The maximum discharge of the Atbara, measured in 1903, was 3,088
metres cube per second, but this is probably surpassed in a year of
very high flood.</p>

<h4>9. <span class="sc">The Nile north of Khartoum</span>.</h4>

<p>The discharges of 1903 record a maximum of 10,500 metres cube
per second in an average year. If to this be added the volume of
the Atbara, a total of nearly 14,000 cubic metres per second is
reached. As in 1903 the levels at both Halfa and at Cairo did not
pass those of a very ordinary flood supply, it would seem probable
that in very high flood a volume of quite 16,000 metres cube per
second must pass Berber.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be stated with confidence that the White
Nile contributes practically nothing to the flood which reaches
Egypt. This is entirely derived from the Blue Nile and from the
Atbara. On the other hand, the supply passing Aswan during the
spring and early summer is due, almost entirely, to the water of
the great lakes brought down by the White Nile.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c02d"></a>(iv.)âNAVIGABILITY (UP STREAM).</h3>

<p>Between Halfa and Khartoum (880 miles) the river may be said to
be navigable throughout at high Nile.</p>

<p>Details are given below as to the various cataracts to be
encountered, but it may be broadly said that, although difficult,
it is not impossible to get boats and steamers through in the time
of the flood. At low Nile most, if not all, of the cataracts are
unnavigable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Before the Nile
Expedition of 1884-85 steamers and boats were taken over the 2nd
cataract. During the expedition both were taken over the 3rd
cataract and intervening rapids, and boats (whalers) successfully
surmounted the 4th cataract. In 1897 gunboats and other steamers
were hauled over the latter place, and the rocks of the 5th and 6th
cataracts have never, when there was enough water, offered serious
resistance to the passage of boats or steamers.</p>

<p>From Khartoum to Gondokoro, practically 1,100 miles, the only
obstacles to navigation at any time of the year are:â</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>1. The Abu Zeid Ford (occasionally only), and the Azalet or
Dankul Rocks near Jebelein, <em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_59">p.
59.</a></li>

<li>2. Scarcity of fuel.</li>

<li>3. The sudd.</li>

<li>4. Sand-banks.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Fuel</span>.âOne of the great economic
questions of the Sudan which would give rise to anxiety were not
the Nile-Red Sea Railway already in course of construction is the
future supply of fuel. Imported coal now costs Â£E.4 to Â£E.6 per
ton, and petroleum Â£6 to Â£E.11Â·500 per ton at Khartoum. Though a
bed of lignitic coal has been discovered at Dongola, no other coal,
nor even lignite, has so far been located within our boundaries.
Wood therefore, is and will for some time remain the chief source
of fuel supply. The large demand which arose with the development
of Khartoum has caused the destruction of forest belts along the
White and Blue Niles to a considerable distance from Khartoum, and
although the Forest Department has now control of the fellings, the
enormous demand is making inroads into the forests from which
subsequent fires preclude recovery.</p>

<p>Wood stations for steamers are established at different points
along the banks, at distances usually sufficiently near to obviate
steamers taking too heavy a load, but there is a long gap between
Khor Attar wood station and Kanisa (about 380 miles), which
necessitates steamers carrying a large amount of firewood to enable
them to cross the sudd region. As there is a heavy tax on the
forests at these wood stations, the fellings are getting farther
and farther away from the bank, and tramways are necessary to work
the more remote portions of the forest.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">The Sudd</span>.âA full description of the
formation of and methods of dealing with the sudd are given in
<a href="#appb">Appendix B.</a> The Nile was blocked by the sudd
from 1870-4, 1878-81, in 1884, and from 1895 to 1900.</p>

<p>The Nile, before it flows into Lake No, appears to be a channel
varying from 100 yards to a mile in width, but, from the masthead
of a steamer, it would be seen that there is a sea of papyrus
grass, bulrushes, and reeds on either side of this water channel,
and that the real banks of the river are 4, 8, or even 12 miles
distant on either side. Under all this vegetation is water, which
is slowly making its way down to fill up the void caused by the
absorption of the water by plants and sun. The matted vegetation
which floats on the top of the water is so thick that it is
possible to walk on it; and, were it not for this covering, the
evaporation over such a vast area would greatly diminish the supply
of water to Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>A considerable part of the Nuer tribe actually live on the
floating mass of vegetation, fish and the stalks of a water-lily
forming their only food. The surface of the water is covered by a
dense tangled mass of papyrus, ambach, and other water plants,
which in places grow to a height of from 15 to 30 feet.</p>

<p>At the rise and fall of the Nile, quantities of the grass get
torn away and float down stream. If the season is unusually wet,
the stream increases in bulk and rapidity, and innumerable large
masses of the grass, hurried and packed by the wind, are sent
floating down; these jamb in the channels and form the sudd
blocks.</p>

<p>The channel of the river is very tortuous; at Lake No, for
instance, where the Bahr El Ghazal flows into the Nile, there is a
sharp turn to the east. If the water contributed simultaneously by
the Bahr El Ghazal happens to be insignificant and incapable of
sweeping away the floating masses, a block is the result at this
point.</p>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Sandbanks</span>.âThey are not as a rule any
considerable obstacle, but are, of course, more troublesome at low
than at high Nile, and shift about every year.</p>

<p>Steamers with no encumbrances, and with fuel ready cut for them
to pick up, take about 12 days up stream from Khartoum to
Gondokoro, and about 8 days down stream. (Record journey in 1903:
11 days up and 7 down).</p>

<p>The navigation up to the mouth of the Sobat is at all times
easy, the Abu Zeid Ford and occasional rocks and sandbanks forming
the only difficulties. The deepest channels lie usually towards the
east bank. From the Sobat to Gondokoro a perfect and recent
knowledge of the route is required, in order not to deviate into
any of the lateral branches which are frequently met with, and
which, varying from year to year, are chiefly in evidence during
and after the rainy season.</p>

<p>There are also many sandbanks on this stretch. Between Gondokoro
and Rejaf the river is rather difficult when low on account of
shifting sandbanks and islands. There are a few rocks, but not
dangerous, except at one point.</p>

<p>Between Rejaf and Bedden there is the same difficulty of
shifting sandbanks and sunken rocks, which are, however, isolated
and few in number, and might be blasted away. The current here is
about 1Â½ miles an hour. At Bedden there is a bad rapid
necessitating a transhipment; but from there boats can go to
Kiri.</p>

<p>From Kiri to Labore there are awkward rapids, but the river
might be utilised to a great extent. The river
continues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> of much the
same character till the junction of the Asua, when the rapids
become more serious, terminating in the Fola Rapids.</p>

<p>The last 15 miles before reaching Nimule are quite impassable to
any steamers or boats.</p>

<p>From here on, the river is free of any obstacles up to Lake
Albert.</p>

<p>Between Dufile and Lake Albert the Nile is very sluggish, and
papyrus islands abound in it. Breadth of channel varies.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Boats and Steamers</span>.</h4>

<p>The usual Nile boats are the âNuggerâ and âGayassa,â varying in
capacity from 5 to 400 ardebs. The latter solidly built, with high
bows, and free board, and lateen-rigged, is the Egyptian boat,
whilst the former, which is found from the 2nd cataract southward,
is flat, with low free board, and is roughly though solidly built
without ribs. Rafts, canoes, inflated waterskins and water-tight
pots are also used for individual navigation. Further up stream
âdugoutsâ and ambach canoes are seen. Of steamers there are 10
gunboats, 21 other steamers, and 6 launches on the river, mostly
stern-wheel; a few are screw, and one or two paddle. (<em>Vide</em>
<a href="#p1c10">Chap. X,</a> Part I.)</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Landing Places</span>.</h4>

<p>From Halfa to Khartoum and from Khartoum up to Goz Abu Guma it
is possible to land almost anywhere on either bank. From there up
to Kodok, owing to the broad reed fringe on either bank, landing is
difficult except at the following places, viz.:âJebelein, Um
Ashrin, Karshawal, Renk, Meshra Leungtom or Domaia, Meshra Zeraf,
Meshra Rom, Kaka, Kaka Wood Station, Melut and Demtemma. All these,
except Kaka and Um Ashrin, are on the right bank.</p>

<p>As Gordon states, in the stretch between Kodok and 100 miles
north of it, âPeople do land, but it is over your knees in the
rainy season,â and even if a landing is effected, progress inland
is always liable to be arrested by wide and deep khors which are
really branches or overspills from the main stream: these obstacles
are encountered even in the dry season.</p>

<p>There are easy landing places in many spots between Kodok and
Lake No, then nothing except Hellet Nuer, Shambe, Abu Kuka, and
Kanisa for 360 miles till Bor; south of Bor the best known ones are
at Kiro, Lado, Mongalla, Gondokoro and Rejaf, though elsewhere a
landing can generally be effected, especially on the left bank of
the western channel, which leaves the main river near N. Lat. 5Â°
30â². Above Rejaf one can land anywhere up to the Fola Rapids.
Between Dufile and Magunga (on Lake Albert) there are five landing
places.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c02e"></a>(v.)âCLIMATE.</h3>

<p>The rains on the Upper Nile in the equatorial regions from the
Albert Nyanza to the Bahr El Ghazal last from February or March to
October or the middle of November.</p>

<p>As one proceeds northwards the heavy rains come later; the
âKherif,â or rainy season, in the neighbourhood of Kodok, lasts, as
a rule, from the middle of May to the end of October, whilst at
Khartoum it may be said to be during July, August, and September.
At Halfa there is no rainy season.</p>

<p>At Gondokoro the hot weather commences middle of November and
lasts till the end of March.</p>

<p>Colonel Stewart states (1883):ââThe rains are very heavy,
lasting 10 to 12 hours at a time. From Gondokoro south to the
Equator, rainy seasons increase in length, till on the Equator it
may be said that rain and sunshine succeed each other in rapid
succession all the year round.â</p>

<p>Heavy thunderstorms and rains occur at intervals during the rest
of the year, especially from October to January in the hilly
regions round Rejaf and the Sudd district to the north of it.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Winds</span>.</h4>

<p>During late autumn winds are very variable, blowing from all
points of the compass. East and south-east winds at this period
predominate, especially in the upper reaches. During the rest of
the year the north wind, varying from north-west to north-east, is
fairly constant, except during the summer rains, when the wind
shifts to the south and south-east.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Temperature</span>.</h4>

<p>The average maximum and minimum shade temperatures on the Upper
Nile during the hot months are 99Â° and 85Â° respectively, and during
the rest of the year 88Â° and 74Â°. Between Khartoum and Halfa the
maximum average is a good deal higher, and the minimum rather
lower.</p>

<p>In the Sudd region and south the maximum averages about 85Â°,
but, owing to the dampness of the district, from April to December
fevers are rife, and the heat and mosquitos are difficult to bear
with equanimity.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>(vi.)âDETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF THE NILE FROM THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE SUDAN TO
GONDOKORO.</h3>

<h4 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c02fs1"></a><span class=
"sc">Section 1.âHalfa to Merowe</span>.</h4>

<p>The northern boundary of the Sudan (and of the Halfa Province),
though nominally the 22nd parallel of north latitude, begins for
administrative purposes on the Nile at Faras Island, 12 miles north
of the point where that parallel crosses the river and 20 miles
north of Halfa. Opposite Halfa the river is some 900 yards broad,
and is navigable up to the foot of the 2nd cataract, 26Â½ miles up
stream.</p>

<p>Beyond the 2nd cataract the river runs through the broken rocky
country of Batn El Hagar, and is full of rocks and rapids which
require careful steering, even for small boats at high Nile, up to
the Amara rapid. Beyond this the river is fairly easy till the 3rd
or Kajbar Cataract is approached. At this point the Nile again
works its way through broken hilly ground covered with boulders,
and from thence it is plain boating, except for sandbanks, till
Merowe.</p>

<p>A road, or rather a fair camel trackâtotal 228 miles from Halfa
to opposite Dongolaâruns along the right bank of the river, taking
short cuts across bends (notably for 35 miles across the desert
between Kosha and Abu Sari) all the way, but has naturally been
considerably superseded by the railway. On the left bank there is
also a through camel track, but it keeps further from the river and
is less used than that on the other bank. (For detail,
<em>vide</em> I.D.W.O. map No. 1489, sheets Wadi Halfa, Kosha,
Dongola, Debba, and Merowe.)</p>

<p>The railway (3 feet 6 inches gauge) extending from Halfa to
Kerma (203 miles) was started in Ismail Pashaâs time (1877),
carried on nearly to Akasha in 1884-5, almost entirely destroyed by
the Dervishes (1885-96) and rebuilt to provide means of transport
for the Dongola Expedition in 1896. Of necessity it was rapidly and
lightly laid, and it is now (1904) in a bad state of repair. Owing
to the great cost which would be involved in its complete repair,
it is to be abandoned (<em>see</em> Chapter X, <a href=
"#p1c10s1">Section 1</a>).</p>

<p>(For administrative and economical details of the Halfa and
Dongola Provinces, <em>vide</em> Chapters <a href="#p1c03">III</a>
and <a href="#p1c09">IX.</a>)</p>

fractions, as a rule only the nearest mile or kilometre is given.
Kilometres, where given, are in italics: 5 miles = 8

districts in uncultivated parts.</p>

<p>All these districts consist of a greater or lesser amount of
cultivated or uncultivated ground, together with a varying number
of palm trees and huts. Each district is under a headman, and
groups of them form the various sub-Districts, each under a Police

strip of cultivation on one or other bank, rarely on both at the
same time. From Ambugol the cultivated land gradually increases in
extent; both banks are cultivated, and the Dar Shaigia is richer
and better cultivated than any district south of the Fayum; the
vegetation here is quite tropical in character, and all the islands
are cultivated. Between Belal and Abu Hamed there is little
cultivation, except in the Monasir (El Salamat) country. There are
numerous villages on either bank, and the mud houses are all
whitewashed and of a better class than those below Dongola,
generally a short distance behind the cultivated strip. The weather
is variable in October; before reaching Debba the north wind is
sometimes lost. Debba to Abu Hamed is a warmer district than the
country below and above these places. Prevailing winds from the
north; native boats have to be towed between the two places named.
The banks themselves are good for towing, but difficulties arise as
the river falls. The most serious obstacles are the Sagias, which
in some cases are only 50 to 100 yards apart.</td>

<h5 class="space-above1"><span class="sc">Sub-Section (a). Merowe
to Abu Hamed</span>.</h5>

<p>The distinguishing feature of the river between Merowe and Abu
Hamed is the difficulty of navigation, and also of communications
along either bank. A variety of rapids, mostly impassable except at
high Nile, form the 4th Cataract, which extends practically from
Belal to Shirri, a distance of about 67 miles, whilst there are
little or no cultivation or supplies, except in patches on either
bank. This (Rapids) portion of the river was ascended in whale
boats by most of the River Column in 1885, and the right bank was
traversed by General Hunterâs flying column in 1897, when
proceeding to attack Abu Hamed. Otherwise it is not now generally
in use for communications,<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> owing to these obvious
difficulties. A telegraph line now connects Merowe with Abu
Hamed.</p>

<p>[The reader who may wish for further detail than that given
below is referred to âN.O.â 1st and 2nd editions (1897 and 1898),
which give some additional reports by slightly different
routes.]</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Remarks on the Shaigia Cataracts</span>.</h5>

<p class="sch5">(<em>Lieut. Poore, R.N., October</em>, 1884.)</p>

<p>The prevailing winds are north-easterly and boats can rarely use
their sails, excepting occasionally at high Nile when a southerly
wind may blow for a few days.</p>

<p>Boats leaving Ambugol for Abu Hamed invariably have to tow the
whole way.</p>

<p>The pilots state the average passage of a nugger<a id=
"FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
from Merowe to Abu Hamed as being from 35 to 40 days, but they
appear to perform the journey in parties of about 10 boats, in
order to supply their own hauling labour, thus considerably
increasing the time of passage.</p>

<p>Nuggers generally leave Debba on the trip to Abu Hamed 20 days
before high Nile and try to time their arrival at Abu Hamed as soon
as possible after the river begins to fall.</p>

<p>Steamers should not leave Merowe for Abu Hamed later than 10
days after high Nile.</p>

<p>Nuggers should not leave Merowe for Abu Hamed later than 15 days
after high Nile.</p>

<p>There are men in the village of Bela at the foot of the Gerendid
Cataract and in a few of the villages near Merowe who are
acquainted with the different cataracts, but would seem to be more
useful as guides to point out the different channels than as
pilots, their knowledge of boats or nuggers seeming very
limited.</p>

<p>It would be advisable to take pilots for the cataracts from the
rais of nuggers.</p>

<p>Supplies between the cataract of Gerendid and Abu Hamed are very
scanty, a few scattered patches of date palms, wheat and dura
constituting all cultivation.</p>

<p>Between the different cataracts the banks appear to be rocky and
badly adapted for towing. The stream is swift with frequent sharp
bends and the river studded with rocks and small islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Confusion may
arise from the custom of the pilots and natives in continuing the
terms east and west as regards the river banks after the river has
turned to the northward at Ambugol; the right bank being invariably
termed the east and <em>vice versÃ¢</em> without reference to the
direction of the river. Thus, between Ambugol and Abu Hamed, a wind
which is termed by the pilots south-westerly is in reality
north-easterly.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Report on Passage of 4th Cataract by Nuggers
and Gayassas</span>.</h5>

<p class="sch5">(<em>Captain W. Doran, August</em>, 1897.)</p>

<p>The following is a report on the river between Kassingar and
Amari, together with remarks on points that have come under my
observation:â</p>

<p>Nuggers with a strong favourable wind can get up to Meshra El
Abiad, but there is a strong current below Meshra El Abiad for
about 3 or 4 miles, and the track (on the right bank) is rocky, or
much obstructed by sunt trees.</p>

<p>Meshra El Abiad presents no great difficulty. About 50 men will
pull a nugger of 200 ardebs through in half an hour.</p>

<p>For about 3 miles after leaving Meshra El Abiad, the channel on
the right bank presents no difficulty, though the stream is strong,
and the banks steep and covered with sunt bushes, which at high
Nile will impede towing.</p>

<p>About 5 miles from Meshra El Abiad the banks become rocky, and
rapids are met with; the water being very bad, and rocks numerous.
I crossed this rapid, which is about a mile in length, and extends
to just below the village of Shebabik, in half a gale. Otherwise, I
should think the passage would be difficult, as the rocks on the
right bank are very steep, and without a strong wind portage would
probably be necessary. From Shebabik village, by following a
channel on the right bank past the village of Abu Haraz, good water
is met with for about 6 miles, till the cataract of Halfaya is
reached.</p>

<p>From Halfaya to the village of Amari, a distance of about 2
miles, the river is very difficult, tortuous, and rocky, towing
being necessary throughout.</p>

<p>From Amari, I am informed, the river is not difficult.</p>

<p>It must be understood that these remarks refer to the river as I
found it. Any rise or fall may make difficult places easy, and
<em>vice versÃ¢</em>.</p>

<p>I would venture to make the following suggestions for future
river convoys:â</p>

<p>1. That only boats of 150 ardebs should be sent up at present.
Large boats are unwieldy, cause great delay, break ropes, and run
the risk of losing stores. For example, one of my boats of 300
ardebs took 4 hours to get up a place which boats of 150 ardebs
crossed in an hour. It broke two ropes, and was nearly wrecked on
several occasions, besides being always a source of delay to the
rest of the convoy. The exertion caused to the men in hauling these
heavy boats is very great, much greater than that of hauling two
boats of half the capacity.</p>

<p>2. Each convoy should consist of not more than 20 boats under a
British officer, and should have with it two companies (200 men) of
an Egyptian battalion to haul the boats over the cataracts, and in
the ordinary stream when the wind is unfavourable. If the water
proves easy beyond this place, Amari, these men might return to
Merowe from here by return convoy. Men who are good swimmers should
be selected, if possible, and, as the work entails great exertion
on the menâmost of them having to stand work in the water all
dayâthe companies should be relieved after one or two trips.</p>

<p>Unless considered necessary for safety, these men should not
bring arms or ammunition with them, except just sufficient for a
small guard, as these have to be portaged across bad places,
causing delay.</p>

<p>The large cooking pot, âkazan,â is not suitable for these
occasions, as men are often separated on islands from the rest of
the convoy at night time, and are unable to get their proper food
after a hard dayâs work. Something of the Flanders kettle type
would be better.</p>

<p>3. Each convoy should be provided with four strong hemp ropes of
at least 200 fathoms each, in addition to the smaller ropes carried
by each boat. These latter should be inspected before the convoy
starts.</p>

<p>A small boat of about 50 ardebs would also be most useful to
enable the officer in charge of the convoy to go up and down his
convoy, and also to assist in the portage of stores from the nearer
boats when they get stuck in shallow places or rocks.</p>

<p>To Kasinjar on right bank, river broad, navigation simple. No
obstacles. Thence to Kenisha, navigation easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>At Meshra El Abiad
there is a difficult, narrow passage between two rocky islands,
with a very sharp turn. Water very rapid, which continues until Um
Deras Island is reached.</p>

<p>N.B.âThe cataract marked on the official map as El Dermi was not
recognisable at this time of the year.</p>

<p>Um Deras Island is practically at the foot of what is termed the
Gab El Abd, or 4th Cataract, it was from thence that a course by
the left bank was followed by the river column in 1884-85. This
channel was found to be so difficult and dangerous at high Nile, it
was decided to examine the channel by the right bank. This was
found to be more easily navigable for steamers at this time of the
year. It should, however, be noted that this channel, though
navigable for steamers at high Nile, and undoubtedly the only
channel to be followed with safety at that time, would be
impassable at any other time of the year. As at low Nile, many
parts of it are dry.</p>

<p>From Um Deras Island to the point marked Khor Abu Herejil (north
bank) (A),<a id="FNanchor_27b"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a> no great difficulties are encountered.</p>

<p>At this point all guns, ammunition stores, and heavy gear of
every description were taken out of the steamers and portaged to
the camp of El Bana, a distance of about 2 miles.</p>

<p>The following arrangements were then made for passing the
steamers over this cataract:â</p>

<p>A wire hawser was fastened round the ship. Two hawsers were then
led out of the steamer, one for hauling, and other to serve as a
guy to steady her, and to prevent her bow from being taken round by
the force of water.</p>

<p>About 600 yards up-stream, at the junction of a smaller channel
(B), these hawsers were slipped, and the steamer reached the
southernmost point of the next bend (C).</p>

<p>From this point to a point 1,100 yards up-stream (D) the
greatest difficulties were met with, owing to the necessity of
passing ropes on to the island 300 yards up-stream (E). As many men
as could swim had to cross over to this island. The steamer was
then hauled up to the southern end of the island.</p>

<p>The rope had now to be passed from the island (E) to point
(D).</p>

<p>At point (D) the haulage became very difficult, as the river
thence, for 600 yards, to point (G), in mid-stream, is intersected
by isolated rocks, upon which it was necessary to have groups of
men in order to pass the rope from one rock to another. From point
(G) the hawser was then led to the mainland. Guy ropes were used
throughout.</p>

<p>After passing the rock marked (G) powerful steamers, of the
âZafirâ class, were able to steam, without further haulage, to El
Bana, but otherwise it was necessary to use ropes for hauling up to
El Bana.</p>

<p>On leaving El Bana, the channel on the right bank was followed,
and though the water was rapid in places, rushing between numerous
small islands, no great difficulty was encountered until arrival at
the foot of the Geridu (Geriddo) Rapids (3Â¼ miles up). Here it was
necessary to tie up to the bank in order that each steamer might
pass over the rapid separately.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the channel takes a very sharp turn here
(between points A and B); a large volume of water rushes with
considerable force between an island (440 yards long, with a rock
at the west end) and the south bank (a promontory on the south
bank), where a rope was attached to a rock, and then gradually
eased off to let the bow go round.</p>

<p>From Geridu to Hosh El Geruf the channel is devoid of
obstacles.</p>

<p>The channel taken was by the right, until El Shwadiyat was
reached, whence it crosses to the left bank and continues thus as
far as Rakabat El Gamal; here the river becomes a maze of small
islands. The channel continues by the left (?) bank of Dulka Island
(known by the natives as Dirbi), smaller islands being left on the
starboard side.</p>

<p>The current thence became very strong, and continued so until
Kirbekan Rapids was reached.</p>

<p>At the bottom of these rapids the steamers were stopped, but the
cataract, after examination, having been considered passable
without haulage, each steamer went over it separately, in order to
prevent any risk of one hampering another.</p>

<p>The main stream was then followed as far as Uss Rapids; here the
volume of water was very great. From the top of Uss Rapids the
channel followed was by the left bank as far as Sherari Island,
whence it passes by the right bank of that island, and thence
between it and Shirri Island to the right bank of the river.</p>

<p>The river now becomes very broad, and navigation is practicable
on either bank from Salamat to Hebi. From Hebi to Abu Selem the
channel is by the left bank. In Huella Rapids there was a strong
rush of water.</p>

<p>The river now becomes much intersected by small islands, and,
though navigation is not very difficult, skilful pilotage is
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abu Hamed.</span>Abu Hamed used to be
chiefly notable as being the point of arrival and departure of the
various caravan routes which traverse the Korosko Desert, and takes
its name from a highly venerated sheikh, whose tomb is here
situated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> The
merchants were in the habit of depositing here any articles with
which they did not wish to encumber themselves during their journey
through the desert, and the environs of the tomb used to be
surrounded by every sort of superfluous impedimenta, left by their
owners to await their return, with no other protection than that
afforded by the sanctity of the defunct sheikh.</p>

<p>Considerable plantations of acacias and doms are found in the
neighbourhood of the village, which is also remarkable for the
numerous âdunesâ or sand hills collected by the winds from the
surrounding desert.</p>

<p>It is a small village, utterly destitute of supplies. The
sterile desert extends to the very margin of the Nile. Altitude
1,040 feet above sea level. Desert perfectly flat. Deep sand.
Major-General Hunter attacked and took the place from the Dervishes
on the 7th August, 1897. (<em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_254">p.
254.</a>) The railway reached this point from Wadi Halfa on 31st
October, 1897. It is now a watering station for trains, with modern
bathrooms for tourists, etc. It is the residence of the Mamur and
inspector of the Monasir and Robatab Districts. It is also proposed
as the junction of a branch line to Merowe.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Section (b).âAbu Hamed to
Khartoum</span>.</h5>

<p>Little has been recorded of the actual navigation of the river
and the description of its banks between Abu Hamed and Khartoum,
and especially of the stretch between Abu Hamed and Berber.</p>

<p>Between these two latter places the desert is broken by numerous
ravines and studded with acacias and âdomâ palms; the river channel
is full of reefs and rapids, and navigation is at all times
difficult and somewhat dangerous; cultivation only exists in scanty
patches, and the inhabitants are poor and few in number. The
inhabitants and cultivation are, however, increasing on both
banks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mograt Rapid.</span>A couple of miles
above Abu Hamed is the Mograt Rapid, consisting of a few miles of
bad passages (at low Nile). After clearing the Mograt Rapid, the
navigation of the river is unimpeded for about 32 miles, until Mero
Island, opposite Abu Hashim, is reached.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bagara Rapid.</span>As an obstacle to
navigation the Abu Hashim Rapid is unimportant, and from the Mograt
Rapid there exists a reach of about 50 miles of practically open
water to the rapid of Bagara.</p>

<p>The Nile here takes a bend to the west, and for the space of 2
or 3 miles the bed of the river is filled with masses of black
rocks, in some places forming dams, over which the river roars in
its swift descent (December). This rapid is passable at high Nile,
but impracticable at low or even mean Nile.</p>

<p>The cataract of Bagara is not long, but during low or even
medium water it is rather rapid.</p>

<p>The banks of the river present no features of interest, and the
country on the eastern shore is an almost uninhabited desert, the
usual âdoms,â which fringe the shore being the only vegetation to
be seen, with here and there a scanty patch of cultivation; but, as
the Bagara Rapid is approached, an improvement takes place on the
western shore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">5th Cataract.</span>The 5th Cataract, or
Shellal el Homar, 24 miles from El Bagara, is a system of tortuous
rapids running through irregular dangerous rocks. It is formed by a
ridge of black rocks, broken up into islands, of which the main one
is termed Draka. Here there are really two distinct cataractsâone
to the north, which has two rather dangerous and difficult
passages, in consequence of the banks being covered with brushwood
rocks and mimosa trees, which prevent the tow rope being employed;
the other to the south, called Shellal el Homar. These cataracts,
like those that precede them, are dangerous and impracticable
during low water.</p>

<p>They were successfully surmounted by the gunboats of the Nile
Expedition in September, 1897 (high Nile).</p>

<p>From the 5th Cataract, where the Dar Robatab is quitted and the
Dar Berber commences, a path exists on both banks for 30 miles to
the town of Berber. About half-way the nature of the soil changes
from the primitive desert to sandstone, and ranges of hills formed
of the latter begin to show themselves on both banks, but more
prominently on the western shore, where, opposite El Hasa, the edge
of a stony plateau, about 100 feet high, known as Jebel Nakam,
advances to within 200 yards of the waterâs edge; thence the road
follows the western shore at a distance of about Â¾ of a mile, the
intervening land being well cultivated and acacias and âdomâ palms
fairly abundant.</p>

<p>On the right bank, although a fringe of acacias borders the
Nile, cultivation is almost entirely absent except in the immediate
neighbourhood of the villages, which are met at frequent intervals;
and the country, after entering the sandstone formation, consists
of nothing but one vast desert plain extending as far as the eye
can reach.</p>

<p>In view of the railway running the whole way along the river
bank from Abu Hamed to Khartoum the description of the itineraries
along the banks is omitted. The reader who desires such is referred
to N.O. (pp. 63-70).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Berber.</span>Berber, 131 miles from Abu
Hamed (for description, <em>vide</em> Chap. III, <a href=
"#Page_85">p. 85</a>).</p>

<p>Between Berber and the Atbara (20 miles) the cultivation
improves, and a fairly broad band runs parallel to the east bank of
the river; the inhabitants in this reach are fairly numerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>The current here
runs at the rate of from 2 to 3Â½ miles per hour; but above it,
where the river increases in width, a proportional decrease in the
rate of the stream takes place, and it does not exceed 2 miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Atbara confluence.</span>The Atbara
River, at its point of junction with the Nile, has a deep,
well-defined section, and a bed-width of some 400 yards; the banks
are steep and high. Although the channel is dry in summer, the
flood marks register a height of 25 feet above the bed. The
velocity of the Atbara current in flood is so great that it forces
the water of the Nile across on to the western bank. The sandbank
thus formed causes considerable difficulty to navigation, and in
the early spring of 1898 caused the division of the fleet of
gunboats into two isolated halves, neither of which could have
moved if required to the assistance of the other.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Damer.</span>South of the junction
lies the town of El Damer, formerly celebrated for its learning and
university. It is now again a town of growing importance, and is to
supersede Berber as the headquarters of the Province. Railway
bridge over the Atbara here. The Nile-Red Sea Railway branches off
up the right bank of the Atbara, north of the bridge.</p>

<p>From the Atbara to Khartoum the distance, by water, is about 200
miles. On this reach the slope of the river is separated by the
Shabluka Cataract into three portions. This cataract begins at some
35 miles from Khartoum, and continues as far as Wad Habashi, 55
miles further north.</p>

<p>Between the Atbara and Shendi (86 miles) there is little variety
in the river scenery.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The average height of the banks over the
river is from 25-28 feet; the channel is broad and interspersed
with many sandbanks and islands. The eastern bank is flat, and
covered with a thick growth of scrub and thorn bushes; the soil is
good, but the halfa grass, owing to years of neglect, has got such
a hold that very considerable labour is necessary in order to
remove it and render the land fit for cultivation. The western bank
is lower, and the strip of cultivable land much narrower than on
the eastern shore. In places, ravines or âkhorsâ run back from the
river, and these in flood must be full of water. The whole tract
has a most desolate appearance; villages are few and poor;
inhabitants and cattle are wanting, although a few small flocks of
sheep and goats are occasionally met with; here and there a sagia
is at work; but the cultivation is confined chiefly to the
foreshore of the river and to the islands. At certain points low
ranges of hills, such as Jebel Egerdan and Jebel Umali approach the
river on either side. Fuel is fairly plentiful, and everywhere the
thorn jungle has encroached and swallowed up the areas which were
once under cultivation. The depopulation of this district must date
from a period anterior to the Dervish rule. Sir Samuel Baker, on
visiting the country in 1869, noted the deterioration and
desolation which had ensued since his visit of a few years
previous. He attributed this ruin to the misgovernment of the
Turkish Governor-General.</p>

<p>The âPyramids of Meroeâ are passed about the 17th parallel; they
lie close to villages named Maruga and Sur. The district here
between the Atbara and the Nile was in ancient times termed the
âIslandâ of Meroe. (<em>See</em> <a href="#p1c04">Chap. IV</a> and
<a href="#appd">Appendix D.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shendi.</span>Shendi, 86 miles from
Atbara mouth, situated on the right bank of the river and on rocky
ground, which extends for half a mile above and below the town, was
once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Meroe, and is said to
have been the residence of the famous Queen of Sheba. Ismail Pasha,
son of Mohammed Ali, was here burnt in his hut by the Jaalin in
1822, in revenge for his barbarities. The town and inhabitants were
destroyed in 1823 by Mohammed Ali. It is now reviving considerably,
and is the headquarters of the Cavalry in the Sudan; it owes its
selection chiefly to the fine grazing, the gravel soil, and the
level country around it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Metemma.</span>Four miles beyond Shendi,
on the left bank, lies Metemma, the terminus of the trans-Bayuda
route from Korti (<em>vide</em> <a href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74585/74585-h/74585-h.htm#route112">
Vol. II</a>), used by the Desert Column in 1885. The town was not
assaulted or taken by our troops on that occasion, but was the
object of a reconnaissance in force, 21st January, 1885; it lay
dormant until 1897, when it became the headquarters of a projected
rising against the Dervishes by the Jaalin tribe. Mahmud, however,
was warned in time, and exterminated the conspirators and all their
belongings. Over 2,000 Jaalin were killed and the town was
destroyed. It is still a deserted ruin, lying over a mile from the
river, but is easily recognisable by the solitary grove of date
palms which stands out as a landmark in the flat and treeless
plain. Here the western desert approaches the waterâs edge, but a
little cultivation is carried on upon the foreshore and the large
island in front of the town. The remains of five Dervish earthworks
still exist upon the bank up-stream of the town, and another
(masked) upon the island. One-and a half miles up-stream lies the
former village of Gubat, the furthest point reached by the Desert
Column in 1885.</p>

<p>Between Metemma and Wad Habashi the whole country appears to be
deserted, and there is a complete absence of life. At one point a
series of honey-combed cliffs approaches the river, and runs
parallel with it for some 5 miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wad Habashi.</span>Wad Habashi (left
bank), 42 miles from Shendi, was the starting point of the 1898
Omdurman Expedition. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_47">[47]</span> soil here is excellent, and the land must
once have been cultivated, as traces of the old water-courses are
still visible. It is now covered with a dense growth of acacia
jungle and halfa grass, which stretches in a thick belt for some 2
miles from the Nile.</p>

<p>About Â½ mile inland a large and deep canal runs parallel to the
river. This whole tract is entirely deserted, and, from its
appearance, it seems probable that it was thrown out of cultivation
prior to the rebellion of 1884. Four miles south of Wad Habashi is
the boundary between the provinces of Berber and Khartoum, the
limits being marked by the isolated granite hill on the east bank,
known by the name of âHagar El Asal.â From this point, the reefs
forming <span class="sidenote">Sixth Cataract.</span>the tail of
the Shabluka Cataract begin, and navigation at low water becomes
impossible for steamers.<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Although the actual
cataract, or rapid, is only some 12 miles in length, the bad water,
above and below the pass, extends for a length of some 55 miles,
<em>i.e.</em>, to Wad Ramla, or to within 35 miles of Khartoum.</p>

<p>In summer, <em>i.e.</em>, if the railway is not used, this
portion of the journey has either to be made in native boats, or by
camel portage round the cataract. The land route is shorter than
that by the river, being not more than 26 miles in length.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wad Hamed.</span>Five miles above Wad
Habashi the former cavalry station of Wad Hamed is passed on the
west bank. This place was selected as the headquarters of the
Egyptian cavalry on account of the good fodder to be found in the
vicinity. From here the difficulties of navigation increase; the
river is split into numerous channels, and winds between
picturesque islands, covered with a luxuriant growth of vegetation.
Rocks and reefs appear above the water, and the swirls and eddies
indicate the existence of many more below the surface. It was in
this part of the rapid, on Mernat Island, that the âBordeinâ
steamer went aground on returning from Khartoum in 1885. Low
serrated granite ridges confine the river on either side.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Shabluka gorge, the channel takes a very
sharp turn to the east, and the section is both deep and narrowânot
being more than 200 yards in width anywhere, and in some places
even less than this. The river runs between high granite hills for
some 4 or 5 miles, with a very high velocity. The marks upon the
rocks show that the highest flood level is not more than 7 feet
above the water level of the river in March.</p>

<p>The northern entrance to the pass was guarded by five Dervish
forts, now in ruins; four on the western and one on the eastern
bank. These completely command the channel. On emerging from this
gorge the river widens out, and the difficulties of navigation
recommence. Reefs, rocks, and islands appear in all directions; the
solitary peaks of Jebel Royan and Jebel Tyem stand out, one on
either bank. At some 20 miles up-stream of the pass Wad Ramla is
reached; from this point to Khartoum navigation, with care, is
possible for steamers, even at lowest Nile. The country on both
sides becomes more open, and many large islands are passed, most of
which, notably that of Tamaniat, bear fine crops of dura. Large
quantities of hay are also grown upon these islands and transported
to Omdurman. The land on the east bank is good, and the cultivable
strip extends for a considerable width, though covered as usual
with scrub and rank grass. On the west bank the desert approaches
the river closely.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c02fb"></a><span class="sc">Omdurman, Khartoum North,
and Khartoum</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Omdurman.</span>At 198 miles from the
Atbara, the town of <span class="sc">Omdurman</span> is reachedâthe
long low ridge of the Kereri hills to the north marking the scene
of the battle in 1898. This town covers a large area, being some 5Â½
miles in length by 1 to 1Â½ miles in breadth. Its eastern frontage
follows the river bank throughout. Two or three broad streets
traverse it, but, with these exceptions, the houses are separated
one from another by a network of twisting lanes. Some of the
principal remaining Dervish houses, notably those of the Khalifa
and Yagub, are spacious and well built. Ebony is much used in the
roofs, and where the span is great, iron girders are inserted to
support the roofing.</p>

<p>The âBeit El Amana,â or Dervish storehouse, covers a large area.
Here are the old powder magazines and stores of a most
miscellaneous description. The open-air mosque is simply a large
inclosure, and within the âSur,â or great wall, is packed a
rabbit-warren of buildings, with narrow and winding streets. The
entire town was, during the Dervish occupation, full of old
cess-pits; these being merely deep holes sunk in the desert, and
open to the air. These pits were probably largely responsible for
the disease for which Omdurman attained such an evil reputation
(Cerebrospinal meningitis), but which has now practically
disappeared. The Mahdiâs tomb and Khalifaâs house, the latter still
in good repair, are objects of interest for the tourist
(<em>vide</em> pp. <a href="#Page_266">266</a> and <a href=
"#Page_252">252</a> respectively).</p>

<p>The town lies in a direct line 3 miles from Khartoumâbut by
water another mile, some 40 minutes by steamer. Very many of the
houses are now deserted, but the population still numbers some
46,000. It lies on good gravel soil, and comprises, besides the old
Dervish buildings above-mentioned, barracks for the garrison, which
consists of 2 battalions infantry and 2 maxims. There is a large
market (Suk), where a considerable trade in gum and other produce
is carried on. On the sloping banks a large boat traffic is at
work. Steamers and ferry boats connect the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_49">[49]</span> town with Khartoum. It is the residence of
the sub-Governor of Khartoum Province who resides in a house built
in the late Khalifaâs enclosure.</p>

includes storehouses, workshops, the headquarters and the dockyard
of the Steamers and Boats Department, barracks for an Egyptian
garrison, consisting of infantry and artillery, Custom-house, etc.,
etc. Population about 2,000. A steam chain ferry, running every
half-hour, connects it with Khartoum.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Khartoum. Principal
towns.</span><span class="sc">Khartoum</span>, including the towns
of Khartoum North (late Halfaya) and Omdurman, together with a
little hinterland (<em>vide</em> <a href="#appg">App. G.</a>),
forms a Province by itself. It is once again the capital of the
Sudan and the seat of Government, though Omdurman still is, and
Khartoum North will probably become in a few years, the principal
trade centre.</p>

<p>Khartoum (meaning elephantâs trunkâwith reference to the point
of land jutting out between the two Niles) is a rapidly growing
town, on the left bank of the Blue Nile, just before it joins the
White Nile, and is built on the site of the old town of the same
name, which was so gallantly held by Gordon and destroyed by the
Dervishes in 1885. Its population is now 8,500 souls, and is
gradually increasing. The soil is alluvial; bank of Blue Nile about
30 feet above the river at low Nile. In 1898 the old town was found
entirely deserted and in ruins.</p>

<p>The main buildings are the Palace (built in 1899), the seat of
the Governor-General; the Government Buildings (including the local
War Office and the Offices of the Sudan Government); the Nuzl or
Government store, the Post and Telegraph buildings, the Mosque, the
Department of Works, the Mudiria (Governorâs office), branches of
the National Bank and the Bank of Egypt, the Gordon College, the
British barracks (holding one battalion of British troops), houses
of the chief officials, and a small town of well-built mud-brick
and stone houses (including a market square, landing place, a good
European hotel, club, brick kilns, Zoological Gardens, etc., etc.),
which is daily increasing in size.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Barracks.</span>At intervals along the
line of the old entrenchments from east to west are the barracks
occupied by the Egyptian Army which are named after Ismail, Tewfik,
and Abbas Pashas.</p>

<p>Outside these lines are villages of mud-built and grass-roofed
houses of various Sudanese tribes, whose members are employed
mostly in building and in other pursuits. (<em>Vide</em> also
<a href="#p1c05">Chap. V.</a>)</p>

<p>Higher up the Blue Nile at Buri are the Gordon College and
British barracks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Town, etc.</span>The town is
symmetrically laid out with wide avenues planted with shady trees,
and the class of buildings erected must be in strict conformity
with the standard fixed for each particular quarter.</p>

<p>The public gardens and âZooâ are situated at the west end of the
town; these, especially the latter, have only as yet reached an
embryo stage.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Garrison.</span>The normal garrison of
Khartoum consists of one battalion of British Infantry, relieved
annually in October, and three battalions of Infantry of the
Egyptian Army, as well as Cavalry and Artillery. (<em>Vide</em>
<a href="#Page_3">p. 3.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Market.</span>The market at Khartoum is
poor and more expensive than that at Omdurman, which is much larger
and better. Meat is usually PT.3 per oke (2Â¾ lbs.) and dura varies
from PT.25 to PT.90 per ardeb (300 lbs.) according to the season
and the year.</p>

<p>Building and fire-wood have to be brought long distances from up
the Blue and White Niles, and are consequently both expensive.</p>

<p>Labour is scarce and difficult to obtain owing to the many
buildings, etc., at present under construction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rainfall.</span>The rainfall is very
variable but that of an average year is very slight;<a id=
"FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
rain seldom falls on more than 10 to 15 days in the year, but when
it does it is generally in heavy thunderstorms, which occur at
intervals from June to October, and are usually preceded by
duststorms, very similar to those at Kassala. In some years heavy
storms occur as early as May.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate is
comparatively good all the year round, though in August, September,
and October, and occasionally at other seasons, a certain amount of

<p>The hottest month, according to the monthly average maximum
temperatures recorded for 1901, is April (110Â·66Â° Fahr.), and the
coolest January (88Â·34Â° Fahr.). April, May and June are here, as
elsewhere, as a rule, throughout the Sudan, usually the three
hottest months of the year. <em>Vide</em> also <a href=

<p>The wind blows from the north almost continuously from November
to April, after which it varies considerably, and finally settles
down in May or June to blow pretty consistently from the south
until the end of October or beginning of November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span><span class=

The Abu Zeid ford is a most serious obstacle to navigation. At this
point, for a length of some 4 miles, the river spreads out in a
broad and extremely shallow sheet, at low Nile about 1,200 yards in
width. Upon the bed, masses of what are called âfresh-water
oystersâ collect. The broken shells form, with a shingle, a kind of
âconglomerate,â almost as hard as rock, and which nothing but a
specially adapted dredger could remove. In March and April, in very
low years, the depth of water here is in places not more than 1
foot 5 inches to 1 foot 8 inches. The forest is very thick on both
shores, and on the west a wide belt of swamp and grass renders
landing very difficult. The papyrus reed is first seen at this
place, and occasional ambach. Floating patches of <em>sudd</em> are
met with in the channel, as well as many permanent large grass
islands, the largest being those of Nuago and Musran. Hippopotami

Province. Jebelein is easily recognisable by the five
peculiarly-shaped granite peaks which rise abruptly from the plain
on the eastern shore. The highest of these peaks is perhaps 600
feet. The nearest is 1 mile from the river, and the farthest 3
miles. They form an amphitheatre of rocky hills; two distinct
masses, with a third hill to the east of the northern mass. Grassy
plain between north and south ridges. Village on east of south
ridge. The forest on the east bank is about a quarter of a mile in
width, and extremely thick. Behind it stretches an endless expanse
of prickly grass, some 3 feet high, interspersed with clumps of
mimosas. Lions and Tiang fairly plentiful. The soil is light and
friable, and much of it must be flooded during the rainy season.
One or two ravines serve as drains to this area. The ruins of Ahmed
Fedilâs âDeimâ are still visible here. This tract once formed part
of the Dinka country, but is now quite uninhabited, most of the
Dinkas having migrated to the south to escape the raids of the
slave-traders. At this point the âserutâ fly makes its first
appearance, and remains an unwelcome guest<span class="pagenum" id=

fly, which is about the size of a small wasp, has a sharp stab, and
if allowed to settle speedily draws blood. Not poisonous. Road 200

<td class="tdl-top hang1">Kaka is one of a collection of Shilluk
villages spread along several miles on the left bank, 400 yards
from the river. From this point southward, the villages on the
western bank of the river are continuous. They cluster along the
ridge and behind the forest. In front of them extends a broad belt
of swamp, mostly dry at low Nile, varying in width from a few
hundred yards to over a mile. Landing at any point along this reach
is impossible except at low Nile. The marsh<span class="pagenum"

and reeds, through which nothing but hippopotami can force their
way</td>

channel, which averages from 300 to 400 yards in width. Near Kodok
these grass islands occur in constant succession, and on the west
bank a double line of Shilluk villages is to be seenâthe one on the
edge of the swamp, and the other further inland. Landing can only
occasionally be effected on either bank of the river</td>
<td class="tdl-top hang1">On the eastern bank the swamp is perhaps
500 yards wide behind it the eternal belt of forest. Outside of
this again stretches an endless plain of high grass dotted with
clumps of trees. This side of the river is quite uninhabited,
except by a few Shilluks who cross the river for the purpose of
hunting or fishing. Occasional big khors run into the Nile on the
eastern bank. These depressions run for many miles inland, and
their banks are covered with a thick growth of thorny trees.</td>

<td rowspan="11" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">The entrance to the
Bahr El Jebel is about 150 yards broad at the extreme east end of
Lake No. The channel, turning suddenly to the south, is bounded on
either side by a dense perpendicular growth of rich green papyrus
swamp, in which ambach trees, and <em>um suf</em> and convolvulus
occasionally appear. The papyrus reaches from 10 feet to 15 feet
above the surface of the water (Jan.). As the steamer proceeds in
its winding course, the channel varies from 70 to 100 yards, whilst
the breadth of the papyrus strip varies from a few hundred yards to
several miles. The solid ground (at its best only a few feet above
the level of the water) on the far side of the papyrus gradually
recedes, and the trees in the distance become more and more sparse,
till at last they vanish altogether. Except in occasional
instances, no dry land is to be seen throughout these swamps. Their
extent is unknown, but, more especially to the west of the river,
it must be enormous. In all probability the greater portion of the
region lying between the Bahr El Jebel and Bahr El Ghazal and its
tributaries is, in the rainy season, a vast marsh. To the east
their area is more limited, as the country beyond the Bahr El Zeraf
gradually rises into alluvial plains, covered with dense grass, and
intersected by numerous swamp lines. These plains, as a whole, are
above the level of the Nile when in flood. In the long island,
lying within the loop formed by the Bahr El Zeraf with the main
stream, there undoubtedly exists a ridge of comparatively high
land. Upon this a Nuer population has settled. Except by occasional
glimpses of trees, and, more rarely, of a village, it is impossible
to trace this ridge. Its limits are undetermined. It is surrounded
on every side by a belt of almost impassable morass. The only
evidence of human beings are the grass fires on the horizon, and,
except for an occasional elephant, buck, or giraffe, visible in the
far distance from the top of the steamer, and a few water-birds,
bee-eaters, wagtails, &amp;c., animal life appears to have suddenly
become extinct. At sunset, however, thousands of insects make their
appearance, but, with the exception of the mosquito, who is always
<em>en Ã©vidence</em> to a greater or lesser extent (worst from
April to November (during the rains) and least from December to
Marchâdry seasonâgrass fires), they vanish after an hour or
two.</td>

<td rowspan="4" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">The water of the Bahr
El Jebel is dark-coloured, but contains little or no sediment. The
depth of the main channel varies from 20 to 24 feet at low Nile. As
far as mile 40, the ridge lying between the Zeraf and the Jebel is
visible on the eastern bank, at a distance varying from 500 to
3,000 yards. Trees and a few palms appear to indicate the presence
of villages. From this point the ridge disappears and the swamps
stretch to the horizon upon both sides of the river. The first four
of the sudd blocks, cleared by Major Peakeâs party, occurred within
this distance. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth blocks were
met with between miles 50 and 63. Upstream of mile 63, the
character of the marsh changes. North of this point comparatively
few open lagoons are to be seen, but from here, until
Hellet-el-Nuer (mile 139) is reached, these shallow lakes border
the Bahr El Jebel in continuous lines. Some of them are of
considerable area, as a reference to the map will show. They form
nurseries for the growth of water plants, and are the chief cause
of the blocks which form in the channel. Their depth rarely exceeds
3 feet. As the river is ascended, these lagoons increase in number
and size. The channel often passes between two of these lakes, only
separated from them by a belt of papyrus. In winter these lagoons
are open spaces of water, but, with the advent of the rainy season
(in the month of April), their surfaces become covered with
detached masses of floating vegetation. Many of them are connected
by a series of openings with the river, and their water level rises
and falls with that of the latter. The loss of water, by
evaporation, upon these shallow ponds, must be extremely great. It
is difficult to say whether these lagoons are old courses of the
Bahr El Jebel and long since filled up, or whether they are traces
of the vast lake which, it is imagined, once covered this area. The
latter supposition appears to be the more probable, as the channel
of the river is so deep and so sharply defined that it appears
hardly possible that it should have utterly disappeared. On the
other hand, there is at least one instance where the river is
actually in process of vanishing, <em>i.e.</em>, between miles 143
and 165. In this reach the channel is filled with decomposed sudd
to such an extent that it is difficult to trace<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> it. It is reasonable to suppose
that, unless cleared, it will, in course of time, disappear and be
transformed into a series of âmayasâ or lagoons. These âmayasâ are
constantly changing their shape. New channels burst into the river
and others fill up and disappear.</td>

<td class="tdl-top hang1">At Hellet El Nuer itself, a branch of
some size takes off the Bahr El Jebel. This channel is not shown
upon any existing maps, and was first mentioned by Captain Gage, of
the 7th Dragoon Guards, in his report upon his journey through the
sudd in the winter of 1899-1900. It has a width of 70 yards, of
which 10 yards on either side are filled by the swamp grasses. Its
average depth, at low water, is 3 feet, and its mean velocity is 2
feet per second. Its discharge, as measured in March, 1901, was
21Â·74 cubic metres per second. Captain Gageâs channel leaves the
Bahr El Jebel at a right angle, but some 500 yards down-stream it
turns in a north-westerly direction. Captain Gage followed its
course for some 40 miles, but was then stopped by sudd. It seems
not improbable that this channel forms a junction between the
waters of the Bahr El Jebel and those of the River Naam, which
discharges into the Bahr El Ghazal, through the Khor Deleib. A few
miles down-stream its banks are lined by a succession of Nuer
villages, and its width increases to 200 yards. It must carry a
large quantity of water when in flood. At other periods of the year
(January) it appears to flow into, not out of, the Bahr El
Jebel.</td>

by sudd for some 20 miles. This is termed block 15, and repeated
efforts to clear it out (1901-02), owing to the total absence of
current, resulted in failure. The expedition under Lieutenant
Drury, 1903-04, very nearly succeeded in clearing the whole of the
true channel. Both Lieutenant Drury and Sir W. Garstin later passed
right through this block in 1904, the only remaining piece near the
southern end of the block being fairly easily navigable. The true
channel is from 16 to 20 feet deep, whilst the false channel to the
west is only 4 feet to 6 feet in depth. One of the Dervish
steamers, with boats containing ivory, was sunk in this part of the
river, and was discovered by the 1903-04 expedition. At present
navigation of the false channel is attended with considerable
difficulty, and the services of a competent pilot are
indispensable. The river is separated into many branches, and these
cross and recross one another, forming a bewildering labyrinth of
islands. At the south end of the small lake before mentioned,
channels converge from all points of the compass. These are
separated by low flats, covered with dense growth of papyrus.</td>

<td rowspan="9" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">After steaming for
some 7 or 8 miles through a wilderness of papyrus, a series of
lakes is reached, at mile 150 from Lake No. Stiff current here.
These lakes have a depth of about 4 feet at the deepest point, but
shoal rapidly towards the shore. A feeble but distinct current
passes through them to the north. Their breadth varies largely.
Their shores are surrounded by high papyrus and their surfaces are
dotted by countless small sudd islands. There are, however,
indications on both sides that the high land is not very far
distant. It has already been explained that the true channel, which
lies to the east of these lakes, is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_75">[75]</span> said to skirt the dry land. On the west a
line of fair-sized trees at a distance of, perhaps, 2 miles, shows
that the swamps in that direction also have a limit. A very
noticeable feature of these expanses of water is their
lifelessness. No birds are to be seen, and hippopotami appear to
avoid them altogether. At mile 163 the lakes end, and a fresh
network of branching streams confront the navigator. Here, again,
very careful steering and knowledge of the passage to be followed
is required. Each year these channels change. What is, in one
season, the deepest channel, is, perhaps, the next year impassable.
For some 5 miles the river is split up into many different
branches, all winding through papyrus swamp. At mile 165 the true
channel of the river is reached. The change is startlingly sudden,
as the depth suddenly increases from 4 to 21 feet. Instead of a
twisting stream, the Bahr El Jebel again becomes a fine open river,
some 80 to 90 yards in width, bounded by a high fringe of papyrus
on either side. The false channel leaves the river at an angle of
nearly 90 degrees. In April, 1900, the junction was blocked by
sudd, but this was light and easily removed. Large shallow lagoons
extend on either bank, separated from the river by a belt of
papyrus. The high land to the west ends about a mile from the
river, and the swamp recommences. To the east a line of palms,
perhaps, 6 or 7 miles distant, not improbably indicates the banks
of the Bahr El Zeraf. Above this point the Bahr El Jebel widens out
for some distance. In places its breadth is as much as 200 yards,
and its depth from 15 to 18 feet. The swamps continue as before. At
mile 166 the high land approaches the river on the east, and runs
parallel to it for some 2 miles. It is covered with bush and an
occasional Euphorbia. At this point a khor joins the Nile on the
west bank, bringing in a strong stream of water. Two villages
(Nuer) are to be seen in the distance; these are probably Favor and
Fatooah of the German map (Julius Perthes). The mean velocity now
averages 1Â½ miles per hour. Between miles 175 and 200 the high land
and bush before mentioned touches the eastern bank at intervals. At
mile 187 there is a break in this ridge, and two or three channels
leave the Nile to the east. These are said by the natives to be the
most northerly outlets of the Bahr El Zeraf. In 1900 a fine deleib
palm stood on the waterâs edge at this point. This formed a
landmark that could be seen for miles. It has now, unfortunately,
fallen into the river. At mile 220, and again at mile 223, channels
come in from the west bringing water to the Jebel. These streams
may possibly be the mouths of the River Rodi, or Yei, which is
supposed to join the Nile somewhere in this locality. At mile 225
the false channel, which, previous to the clearance of blocks 16 to
19, was the only navigable line, joins the river. This was the
route followed by Major Peake and Lieut. Drury in 1900, in making
the journey to the upper Nile. They found the passage very
difficult. During the transit they bent their rudder twice, and
went aground four times. From this point numerous channels join the
Bahr El Jebel on both sides. Many islands, covered with ambach and
papyrus, separate the stream into numerous branches, and the whole
country is once more a waste of swamp. The Bahr El Jebel here is
extremely narrow (25 to 30 yards), but is from 18 to 22 feet deep.
The false channel in appearance far more resembles the main river
than does the true one.</td>

that this narrow, twisting stream can be the Nile. Its windings are
worse than ever. A tree or a boat may be visible at a comparatively
short distance ahead, and yet many miles of channel must be
traversed before it is reached. The river here runs nearly due
west, while the false channel follows an easterly course, passing
through numerous shallow lakes, until it joins the main river again
at mile 249. At mile 240 the Jebel widens out again, and more
resembles a river in appearance than it did. Its average breadth is
from 50 to 60 yards, and its depth is some 15 feet. Between this
point and mile 248 occurred the four sudd obstructions, removed in
February, 1901, by Lieut. Drury, R.N., and which were known as
blocks Nos. 16, 17, 18, and 19. At mile 249 the Bahr El Zeraf takes
off from the Nile, following the false channel for some distance,
before branching off to the east. The width of this river at the
head is about 30 yards, and the outlet is surrounded by a sea of
marsh. Just up-stream of this point there is a severe bend in the

<td class="tdl-top hang1">The general character of the landscape
now changes, as land and forest are visible to the west, and at
mile 253 from Lake No, the Shambe lagoon or khor is reached. This
is a large lake, some 3 to 5 miles in length, and more than 1Â½
miles in breadth. Its depth averages 4Â½ feet. The post of Ghaba
Shambe is situated in north latitude 7Â° 6â² 30â³, on the west bank of
its lagoon, at a distance of 1Â½ miles from the river. The land here
is about 2 feet over the water, but rises as the forest is reached.
It is a dreary-looking spot, consisting of a mud-brick house inside
a mud parapet, and a nuzl, and a few âtuklsâ erected on the flat
shore of the lake; garrison of 25 men; a Dinka village lies not far
off. Shambe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> is now
the chief Nile post of the Bahr El Ghazal province, and from here
proceeds the road inland to Rumbek (116 miles), &amp;c. The river
winds round the lake for some 8 miles, separated from it by a band
of marsh, about 600 yards broad. Large quantities of hippopotami.
To the east the swamp stretches for a long way; at miles 255 and
256 are two other outlets of the Zeraf River. The aspect of the
landscape is extremely desolate, with papyrus-covered marshes
stretching in all directions. The river itself alternates between
long straight reaches or easy curves, and a series of sharp twists
and bends, which form a regular maze through the swamps. The water
surface is covered with masses of detached plants of the
<i>Pistia</i> (or sword grass) <i>stratiotes</i>. The mean velocity
is 2 miles per hour; the average depth is 15 feet; and the average
width from 50 to 60 yards. For many miles the same dreary scenery
prevails. The river recedes a long way from the western forest, and
on both sides an expanse of reeds and water extends. The width of
the swamped area here cannot be less than 30 miles.</td>

abandoned in 1864 or 1865, on account of the deadly effects of the
climate. The only inhabitants now are a few Dinka. The forest is

see how the Bahr El Zeraf marshes are formed. At every few hundred
yards the river spills into them. These spill channels are deeply
cut, with vertical sides, as if dug by hand, and the amount of
water discharged by them in flood must be very great. In size they

from the river on the east bank, but the high bank comes close to
the water, except where a large backwater or lagoon passes through
it for some 2,000 yards. Gordon mentioned this place as an
inconvenient wooding station, but it is very handy now. A few tall
deleib palms stand out as land marks. The houses of Bor are neither
large nor important, but like in all Dinka villages they are
well-kept, neat, and clean. The huts are circular in shape. They
are plastered with mud and have conical thatched roofs. Each has a
small door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> through

cattle. At mile 384 the river runs close under the high bank,
hugging it for some distance. The land here is from 6 to 8 feet
over the water, and is, of course, never flooded. The forest
consists of thick bush, with a few large trees; a distinctive
feature is the thicket of small deleib palms which cover the
ground. Not one in 500 of these young palms appears to develop into
a tree, but they form an extremely dense undergrowth. The Bahr El

sand, covered with a thin surface of clay, and with streaks of clay
running through them. These swamps, except in the centre of the
valley, are, as a rule, well over summer water-level, and the loss
of water can be as nothing compared with that north of Bor. The
vegetation, too, is of a different kind, being chiefly grass, and
though dense enough, is not composed of those reeds which require
to have their roots under water for a great portion of the year. At
mile 390 the Dervish âDeimâ is visible, situated on the east bank.
This is the place held for so long by the Emir Arabi Dafaalla. The
spot is well chosen for defence, as the river sweeps round it on
two sides. The bank all round has been cleared of bush for a long
way. The âDeimâ is surrounded by a mud wall forming a rectangle, of
which the river forms one side. The inclosure is some 400 yards
deep by 700 yards in length. The mud bank, fast disappearing, is
about 4 feet 6 inches high, with an outer ditch 3 feet deep by 4

to the waterâs edge, and from 6 to 8 feet high. At such points
there is always great erosion. The scenery more resembles that of
the Blue Nile than the White. The forest close to the river, the
high banks, the profusion of creepers and undergrowth, the boils
and eddies of the river along these curves, combine to form a
picturesque scene, utterly different from that usually met with on
the White Nile. About 22 miles south of the Deim the Dinka
inhabitants are replaced by those of the Bari tribe. The difference
is at once apparent. The âtuklsâ are untidy, crowded together, and
badly built. The people seem poor and possess few cattle. They live
chiefly by fishing; in April the whole population is engaged in
preparing the land for cultivation, if the river allows, chiefly on
the west bank. At mile 404 the river bifurcates, one channel
branching off to the west, while the other, and the deeper, follows
the eastern bank. These two channels reunite at mile 422. The width
of the island between them is not very great, being rarely more
than 800 to 1,000 yards. The west bank is now a flat grass plain,
marked by swampy depressions. The river must top this in flood, but
not to any depth, as the marks show that the total rise cannot
exceed 4 feet. The west bank is inhabited by the Aliab tribe, a
sort of cross between Baris and Dinkas, but they consider
themselves quite distinct. The solitary mass known as Jebel Lado is
now first visible on the south-west horizon. The river above the
junction of the two channels averages 80 yards in width and 11 feet
in depth. The bends and twists are never-ending, and there is
hardly a straight reach in its whole length. The banks are very
sandy, as are the flats which show up above the water. Occasional
small islands separate the channel into two or more branches.</td>

decided ridge on either side of the main channel resembling that
described in the White Nile. East and west of this ridge the level
of the flats is lower, and in the depressions lagoons are formed
and winding channels wander. The average width of the valley here
cannot be more than from 5 to 7 miles. On either bank the forest
line marks the high ground. On the narrow ridges above described
are located a few groups of Bari huts surrounded by fields of dura.
The high ground does not average more than 100 to 200 yards in
width. At mile 431 a magnificent tree used to be situated on the
eastern shore. It made a striking landmark, but disappeared in
1902.<a id="FNanchor_39b"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> The forest rises rapidly from the water, and at
its highest point is quite 20 feet above summer level.
One-and-a-half miles up stream, the river, which has followed the
eastern bank for so long, now winds<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_79">[79]</span> across in a westerly direction. In thus
crossing the swamps, an excellent idea of the general section of
the valley is obtained. In the centre the flats are, perhaps, 2
feet above the water; towards the sides they rise to a height of 4
feet and sometimes 4 feet 6 inches. The lower portions are marked
by a series of lagoons. These marshes are only, however, swamped
when the river is in flood, and even then not to any great depth,
as the total flood rise is not more than 4 to 5 feet over summer
level. The valley averages 8 to 10 miles in width. The forest and
thick bush extend to a long distance away from the river. Progress
through this forest is only possible by means of the elephant
tracks, which are very numerous. At mile 438 the channel again
bifurcates, the two branches reuniting 5 miles up-stream. There are
so many islands and so many side channels, that it is almost, if
not quite, impossible to find the whole stream contained in one
single channel, and this is the case the whole way between Bor and
Gondokoro. The river varies immensely in width. In places it is
from 200 to 300 yards broad, and in others only 80 to 90 yards. As
the Bahr El Jebel is ascended the average depth decreases, and
throughout the reach between Kiro and Lado is rarely more than from
6 to 9 feet. At mile 451 the river touches the western forest edge,
having traversed the marshes. The trees on this side are, as a
rule, finer than those in the eastern forest. The bank, at the
waterâs edge, is from 3 to 4 feet high, but rises rapidly to a
height of 12 to 16 feet above the water. At mile 456 used to be an
Anglo-Egyptian station, 1901 (west bank), now abandoned. The
scenery here is very fine, and luxuriant tropical vegetation
abounds. Giant Euphorbia are a marked feature of the landscape. The
whole of the banks and most of the trees are covered with a
velvety-looking mass of creepers. A bluff, 10 to 12 feet high, juts
out into the stream, but the action of the current is so strong
that the friable soil is being rapidly eaten away. The face of this
cliff is perforated by myriads of holes, made by a very beautiful
and tiny species of bee-eater. These birds have rose-coloured wings
with bronze-coloured bodies. They add much to the beauty of a
lovely scene.</td>

Kiro, the most northerly in the Lado Enclave, is situated on the
western bank. The latitude of Kiro is apparently between 5Â° 12â² and
5Â° 13â² north. The erosion caused by the river here is very great,
large masses of the sheer cliff, which is 15 to 20 feet over the
summer water-level, are constantly falling into the Nile. It seems
probable that unless they take protective measures the Belgians
will be forced to retire their houses some distance back from the
water. Kiro is a picturesque-looking place. The huts are well laid
out and neatly built. The cantonment is surrounded by a brick wall,
with places for guns, parapet, and ditch. The Commandantâs house is
a comfortable-looking structure, with a good thatched roof and a
deep verandah. The forest surrounds the station. The garrison
consisted in January, 1903, of some sixty-five men. It possessed a
small steamer (the âVan Kerckhoven,â called after the leader of the
first Congo Expedition to the Nile, 1889; the boat is clumsy and
draws 4 feet of water; but having been brought in sections overland
from the west coast she is entitled to respect), and several steel
sailing boats. The negro soldiers differ largely in type from the
inhabitants of the Nile valley. In figure they are short and squat,
and some of them are much tattooed. They are recruited from the
West Coast, and from the tribes in the Congo valley generally, and
make excellent and very mobile soldiers. Upon an island opposite
the station vegetables and paw-paw trees are grown. Beyond this
there appears to be little cultivation. Kiro is extremely unhealthy
in the rainy season. In two years the Belgians lost 9 Europeans and
300 natives from fever. Black-water fever is not uncommon here, and
guinea-worm is a prevalent complaint. One-and-a-half miles
up-stream of Kiro two fair-sized lakes are enclosed by the western
forest. These evidently receive the drainage of the high land from
a considerable distance. On the east bank a khor, passable for
small steamers, runs north-north-east, rejoining the river just
north of Kiro. From here to mile 467 the river skirts the western
bank. Everywhere severe action is taking place, and many trees have
fallen into the water. Three miles on another large lake opens out
in the forest. At one end of it the Lado mountain forms a
background, making an imposing picture. At mile 468 another
bifurcation occurs. The western branch follows the forest as far as
Lado, but navigation in summer by this channel is difficult. The
eastern branch crosses the marshes. There are several connections
between the two channels. The river now averages from 250 to 300
yards in breadth. At mile 472 the eastern forest is again reached.
Here there is a good wooding station, as the trees and high land
come down close to the waterâs edge.</td>

The depth is rarely more than 9 feet, though there are occasional
pools of 12 to 16 feet in depth. Hippopotami used to be extremely
numerous and particularly obtrusive, but seem lately to have
disappeared. A few huts are to be seen, chiefly on the eastern
shore. Most of these have been recently constructed, as many of the
Bari have migrated from the west to the east bank of the river, and
have settled on Sudan territory. At mile 477 the river again leaves
the east bank and crosses the swamps. The width of the valley now
contracts to some 4 miles. Such a labyrinth of streams winds
through these grassy flats that, without an experienced pilot,
navigation would be extremely difficult, more especially as the
depth of water rapidly decreases. As it is, there are so many sand
banks that it is difficult to proceed at night. At mile 494 the
west channel, mentioned as branching off at mile 468, rejoins the
east branch, and half a mile up-stream the station of Lado is

Enclosure contains about 20 good brick straw-thatched houses, and
good tukls for the men. Road leads to Rejaf (broad) and thence to
Yei, Ibembo and Mbima. Native track also to Kiro. Good bamboo and
some gum about Jebel Lado. Forest close by. Few or no supplies. The
neighbourhood of Lado is a desolate-looking spot, not nearly so
picturesque as Kiro, but, on the other hand, healthier. A flat
plain with bushes stretches from the river for about 2 miles. From
here the forest commences, and gradually rises to the spurs of
Jebel Lado, which is some 12 miles from the station. The food for
the troops has to be brought from a very long distance. In front of
Lado is a low island, upon which vegetables, bananas, and
castor-oil plants are grown. This island is 4 feet over low-water
level at the south end, and was topped by the 1903 flood. According
to the Belgian officers, the flood water contains but little
sediment beyond sand, and this statement is borne out by the
deposit on the flats and banks. They further state that in flood
the colour of the water scarcely changes at all. There appears to
be no trade whatever, but a good deal of cultivation. The ivory
collected here is small. India-rubber is apparently not found
within any reasonable distance of the Nile. Owing to the two yearsâ
drought and one yearâs flood, the natives on the west bank of the
river had no supplies. Lado possesses a fine herd of long-horned
cattle for the use of the garrison. Fever is very prevalent during
the rainy months, but does not appear to be of such a deadly type
as at Kiro. In April, 1901, the rains had already commenced.

scenery improves. Eleven ranges of irregularly-shaped peaks are
visible to the east and south-east. Most of them are covered with
scrub, and round the bases the bamboo is said to grow in
luxuriance. From the river bank up to these ranges extends a broad
expanse of reeds and grass, bounded by a dark forest line. To the
west the country rises rapidly in a series of ridges clothed with
forest. The Bahr El Jebel now averages from 250 to 300 yards in
width, and the depth ranges from 6 to 8 feet. Islands and side
channels abound, and in flood time it must be difficult to say
which is the main stream. The loss of water is comparatively small,
as the grass flats are high. Numerous Bari villages on the east
bank and on the islands, but few on the west bank. Further south,
range upon range of hills show up in the distance, one beyond the
other. These are not very high, but are of striking outline and
form an agreeable change to the eye, after days passed in the
dreary flatness of the Jebel marshes. The width of the valley is
here about 5 miles from bank to bank. The Bari villages increase in
number on the east bank as the river is ascended. Jebel Lado still
dominates the western landscape, and Jebel Rejaf, a pyramidal and
solitary peak, marks the point where the reefs and rapids begin. On
approaching Gondokoro, navigation becomes more and more difficult
as the water shoals rapidly, and the maze of channels and islands
are perplexing and intricate; half a mile from Gondokoro are some
bad shallows.</td>

<td class="tdl-top hang1">At mile 504 from Lake No, the station of
Gondokoro is reached. This place, on the east bank of the Bahr El
Jebel, is the north frontier post of the Uganda Protectorate.
Gordon gives the latitude of Gondokoro as 4Â° 54â² 29â³ north, and the
longitude as 31Â° 43â² 46â³ east. The altitudes given by different
authorities vary so much that they are not worth recording.
Gondokoro, although a healthy-looking station, has a deserted and
scattered appearance. The buildings, mostly of bamboo and straw
with brick houses for the European staff, contrast but poorly with
those of the Belgians at Lado and Kiro; the station was occupied in
1899. The Collectorâs house, or Residency, is situated about 300
yards to the north of the garrison lines, and 130 yards from the
river. It is built of burnt bricks, with a high thatched roof, on
ground 16 feet, or more, above the river, and surrounded by a thorn
zeriba. This and the M.O.âs house are raised on brick arches from
the ground and surrounded by gardens and cultivation. The thorn
scrub approaches to within 1000 yards of the houses. The station is
situated on a high cliff, from 18 to 39 feet above the water. Much
of this cliff has fallen in, and the foundations of the Austrian
Mission Buildings, abandoned in 1858, are now on the extreme edge
of the high bank. A few deleib palms and lime trees mark this
bluff. The station extends over an area of about 1 by Â½ mile. The
new lines are built some 400 yards back from the river. The present
huts which accommodate the small garrison are circular huts of mud
and grass. There is also a police barracks containing about 25 men.
The remains of Bakerâs old lines are still existing. He had here a
garrison of 1,500 men, but in his time the Bari was a powerful and
warlike tribe. Gondokoro was, moreover, an important centre for the
slave trade. Bakerâs old lines consist of three rectangles, one
within the other. The inner one is about 300 by 400 yards; the
second, 500 by 800 yards; while the outer is, perhaps, 1,000 to
1,200 yards square. Each of these rectangles is surrounded by a mud
bank about 4 feet high, with an outer ditch 4 feet deep by 6 feet
broad at the top. There used to be plenty of trees, bananas,
paw-paws, etc., and the station was, on the whole, a pretty one,
but floods and white ants have now destroyed many of the trees. To
the south and north of the station, and also 1Â¼ miles to the east,
are large marshes, which must tend to make the place unhealthy. At
times wild elephants come close to the lines. Many Bari villages
are located on the river near Gondokoro. All these are on the east
side. The Bari appear to be better agriculturists than are either
the Dinka, Nuer, or Shilluk. They cultivate dura, ground nuts,
beans, and a little tobacco; also sweet potatoes, and manioc. A
small market for local produce has been established, and Bari and
Luluba keep it fairly well supplied; time, it is hoped, will bring
an increase in population and cultivation. The castor-oil plant
grows like a weed in this locality. The average maximum flood rise
of the river here over summer level is not more than 4 feet. In the
flood of 1878 it rose to a height of 7Â·2 feet on the gauge (Chelu).
The general direction of the river here is north and south, so that
Gondokoro is well situated with regard to the prevailing winds. The
main channel, opposite the station, is about 400 yards across, but
is separated from the main land by a large island.</td>

<p class="sch">NORTH-EASTERN SUDAN.</p>

<hr class="decor width3 spaced2">

<p class="hang2">(Country bounded on the north by the
Sudan-Egyptian frontier, on the west by the Nile from that frontier
to the mouth of the Atbara, on the south by the Atbara and
Abyssinian and Eritrean frontiers, and on the east by the Red
Sea.)</p>

<h3><a id="p1c03s1"></a><span class="sc">Section 1.âCountry between
Halfa and the Atbara Mouth along the Nile Banks</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>Along the Nile from Faras
to Halfa the east bank is fairly well cultivated. From Halfa to
near Kosha, with the exception of Sarras, there is little
cultivation and practically no inhabitants. Most of this stretch is
rocky and desert-like, and is known as âBatn El Hagar.â South of
Kosha cultivation and villages become more general, and continue
almost uninterruptedly to Abu Hamed (<em>see</em> Chap. II,
Sections <a href="#p1c02fs1">1</a> and <a href="#p1c02fs2">2.</a>
For the left bank, Dongola town, etc., <em>see</em> <a href=
"#p1c09">Chap. IX.</a>)</p>

<p>Between Abu Hamed and the Atbara junction there is little
cultivation on the east bank, except south of Genenetti. From here
to the Atbara there are about 500 sagias. The cultivated land, as a
rule, extends about 500 yards back from the river, and in a few
places as much as 3 miles.</p>

<p>The country enclosed by the river and the mainline Sudan
Government Railways between Halfa and Abu Hamed is waterless,
sandy, or gravelly desert, broken here and there by rocky hills and
ridges. It is practically uninhabited, but is believed to contain
minerals and workings of old mines near Kuror, etc. These are now
being explored.</p>

<p>The soil on the banks of the river in the Dongola Province is
rich and alluvial almost throughout, and well adapted for cotton
cultivation. This province is in fact the richest and most
prosperous in the Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>Health is excellent all
the year round. Very little fever, only simple cases. Little rain;
showers may be expected in September. The wind is almost constantly
from the north. Ophthalmia, common in Egypt, is rare in Dongola
Province. During months June to end of September, the weather is
very hot and enervating, but air dry.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Communications. Roads.</span>Good roads,
5 metres in width, have been made on both banks of the Nile
throughout the Province; bends can be cut off frequently, notably
between Kosha and Abu Sari, a distance of 35 miles across the
desert with no water (<em>see</em> <a href="#p1c02">Chap. II</a>).
There is a desert track on the right bank from Dongola (Naui) to
Merowe, a distance of about 100 miles without water, and there are
other desert tracks which have never been traversed by a white man;
of these latter little or nothing is known.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boats.</span>Heavy goods, such as
merchandise, grain, dates, etc., are mostly carried by boat, and
there is no lack of transport for the needs of the natives in this
respect; boats are constantly being built, and every encouragement
is given them to do so.</p>

<p>A fortnightly post boat runs between Kerma and Merowe. From
February to June, however, the low state of the river renders
navigation for steamers dangerous through the rapids between Kerma
and Dongola; during these months, therefore, the mail is carried by
camels over this reach of 40 miles, transport requirements being
conveyed by Government gayasas, of which there are 9 in the
Province. There are two steamers (1903).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population, riverain, and
desert.</span>From Halfa to Debba the inhabitants are
Berabra.<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a> The Mahasi dialect is spoken from Halfa to
Kerma. Here the Gararish<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and then the Danagla
(Berabra), commence and continue to Debba; from there on to Berti
are the Shaigia. From Berti to Khulla the Monasir are found, and
then come the Robatab, who extend as far as Kerraba. From here on
to the Atbara junction are the Angariab, Hagab, Merifab, and
Fadlab. The few inhabitants of the desert are mostly wandering
Bisharin.</p>

<p>The total riverain population of Dongola Province numbered
(December, 1902) 105,026, and is rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>This is exclusive of nomad Arabs, whose numbers may be put down
at 2,000 Gararish (along the river), besides Bisharin, and other
Nomads (<em>vide</em> <a href="#appf">Appendix F.</a>) on the left
bank.</p>

<p>The occupation of the people is that of cultivating the ground,
which they do very imperfectly except in Dar Shaigia; it could be
made to produce double the amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>The natives of
Mahas and Sukkot lag behind, the fault being entirely their own;
they are of an extremely indolent nature, perpetually quarrelling
amongst themselves over questions as to ownership of land and date
trees, and do little or nothing towards bettering themselves.</p>

<p>There is naturally a certain proportion of poor in the province,
but agricultural labour being in demand, employment is always to be
obtained by persons not too lazy to work.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>The cereals mostly
cultivated on the river bank are dura, barley and wheat. Cotton has
hitherto been grown to a limited extent for local use only. On the
completion of the Nile-Red Sea Railway a great increase in cotton
culture is expected. A large amount of land, admirably suited to
the cultivation of this valuable commodity, is available, and very
large issues of Egyptian cotton seed have this year (1904) been
made by the Government.</p>

<p>In the Berber Province the wheat and barley grown are of good
quality, but both are expensive to cultivate.</p>

<p>N.B.âThe majority of the land will give three crops yearly,
viz., twice dura and once wheat or barley.</p>

<p>The number of sagias in the Dongola Province in December, 1902,
was 3,462, besides 77 shadufs and two pumps. There are now (1904),
nearly 4,000.</p>

<p>Iron sagias, though tried, have been pronounced unsuitable as
they are difficult to repair. Iron fittings for the old wooden
sagias have, however, proved a decided success. European ploughs
are not popular on account of their weight.</p>

<p>The chief requirement of all the riverain Provinces is
agricultural labour, men of the fellahin type, who would teach the
inhabitants how to till and tend the soil, and thus produce crops
in proportion to the value of the land.</p>

<p>The local breed of cattle is fair, and moderately numerous, but
might be improved in both respects.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dates.</span>The date tax (PT.2 per tree)
is one of the principal items of revenue in Dongola. There are also
a considerable number of trees in the Berber Province. It is hoped
that the new railway will enable dates to be much more largely
exported,<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a> and thus materially increase the revenue of
these Provinces. At present the freights are almost prohibitive.
Date harvest, October and November. Quality in Dongola excellent,
and ripen before those from Egypt, Tunis or Tripoli. In Berber the
dates are not so good.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dom palms.</span>The dom palm furnishes a
means of livelihood to many of the riverain inhabitants in the
Berber Province. The leaf is made into mats, sandals, and baskets.
Coir (lif) is largely exported to Omdurman, where it is made into
rope.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Other trees.</span>Besides the above,
there are sunt trees mostly used for sagia building, and selem,
talh, samr, and heglig mostly on the back lands, with haraz and the
dwarf tarfa on the river bank. Tamarind trees are being introduced
and are doing well.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Senna.</span>A certain amount of senna
grows wild in the Berber and Dongola Provinces. It is gathered by
the Arabs, who transport it to Kordofan, and Aswan, where it
fetches about Â£E.2Â½ per camel load.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fruit.</span>Melons and lemons are
plentiful in the spring and autumn. People are commencing to
cultivate the vine.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>The import trade of the
Dongola Province consists chiefly of cotton goods and such luxuries
as sugar, tea, coffee, perfumery, etc., and of the export of
cereals and dates. Business, however, is not brisk. The chief
obstacle to the development of the import trade is the want of
enterprise on the part of traders. There are excellent openings for
merchants. The people are well off and willing to buy, especially
such goods as cutlery, crockery, soap, agricultural implements,
hardware, and such sundry merchandise, but at present (1904) there
is not a single well-to-do trader in the Province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Native cotton
cloth, called âdamur,â is worked throughout the Province, and forms
the chief clothing of the men, who dress in shirt and drawers, with
ferda (or toga) of this material.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Administrative.</span>Crime is small in
proportion to number of population. Inhabitants most peaceably
inclined, and all (men, women, and children) work at their
crops.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Housing.</span>Villages are mostly
composed of well-built houses straggling along the borders of
cultivation. The houses are built of galus (mud and stones), with
good court yards, whitewashed and clean. Very superior to those of
fellahin in Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Miscellaneous insects.</span>The
âNimettaâ fly, a small midge, appears in countless myriads from
November to April, both months inclusive, between Dalgo and Korti.
The bite causes slight fever through irritation. At times they are
absolutely unbearable, and cause temporary migrations of both white
men and natives. Natives wear bunches of smouldering grass twisted
round the head to keep off the fly.</p>

<p>White ants also are both numerous and most destructive between
Dalgo and Korti.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Chief towns. <span class=
"sc">Halfa</span>.</span><span class="sc">Halfa</span> (Wadi
Halfa), comprising âThe Campâ and âHalfa townâ is the capital of
the Province of Halfa,<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which extends along the
Nile from Faras Island (N. lat. 22Â° 10â² approximately) to Abu
Fatma. It is also the present headquarters and terminus of the main
line (Sudan Government Railways) to Khartoum, as well as of the
branch to Kerma. There are extensive railway workshops at the Camp.
The latter includes barracks, prison, officersâ mess, native
quarter, and the old fortifications. Also post and telegraph
office. Population about 400, of which one-quarter are white. No
garrison at present. Halfa was for years (1885-96) the headquarters
of the Frontier Field Force which defended the southern frontier of
Egypt against the Dervish invasion.</p>

<p>The civil quarter of Halfa lies 1Â½ miles to the north of the
Camp. Here there is an excellent hotel, also railway station, post
and telegraph offices, some good stores, and native bazaar. The
population, which is composed chiefly of Egyptians and Sudanese,
with a large sprinkling of Greeks, is about 2,900.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc">Berber</span>.</span><span class="sc">Berber</span> is a long
straggling mud-built town containing about 5,000 inhabitants. It
was captured by the Mahdists after a certain resistance on the 26th
May, 1884, and was re-occupied by the Anglo-Egyptian forces under
Lord Kitchener on 6th September, 1897. It is now the capital of the
Berber Province, but this will be moved to El Damer in 1905
(<em>vide</em> <a href="#p1c04">Chapter IV</a>). There are at
present two railway stations, Berber Camp and Town. Post and
telegraph office. There are no good stores in the town, and there
is little trade here at present. The present town lies 2 miles to
the north of old Berber, and is the headquarters of an Egyptian
battalion.</p>

<p>The desert road to Suakin starts from here (242 miles). Behind
the town an immense flat plain stretches to the horizon. This is
fertile soil, and only awaits proper irrigation to be reproductive.
Berber is 1,140 feet above the Mediterranean or 95 feet below the
level of Khartoum.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Section 2.âCountry between Halfa, Berber,
Suakin and the Intersection of the 22nd Parallel with the Red
Sea</span>.</h3>

<h4 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c03s1a"></a>(<em>a</em>)
<span class="sc">Between the Railway and the Nile</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>For purposes of
description this area is conveniently divided into two portions by
the Halfa-Abu Hamed Railway. The portion west of the railway
comprises some of the most arid country in the Sudan. The general
formation is that of a plain covered with sand or gravel, dotted
here and there with steep and even precipitous hills of from 100 to
800 feet elevation above the plain, which falls gently and
uniformly to within a few miles of the Nile. In places these
detached hills are so numerous and so close together as to resemble
connected ranges. As a rule the sand is coarse and heavy enough to
afford excellent going for camels; but strips of soft deep sand are
occasionally met with, especially where the wind has banked it up
against or between the hills.</p>

<p>The crest of this gently sloping spur projecting into the bend
of the Nile, is some 2,000 feet above sea level, where the railway
crosses it, that is some 1,550 feet above Halfa and 1,080 feet
above Abu Hamed.</p>

<p>The country midway between the river and the railway has been
little visited, and the only known place of any importance is J.
Kuror, the highest hill west of the railway and some 4,070 feet
above the sea. After heavy rains its âMakhzans,â or rocky
reservoirs, hold water for many months, and are occasionally
visited by nomad Arabs.</p>

<p>Immediately south of Halfa the plain terminates in a belt of low
hummocky hills, some 8 to 10 miles wide. After Sarras, the belt
becomes wider and the hills bolder, till they culminate in J. Ago,
east of Akasha, at the southern end of the Batn El Hagar.</p>

<p>Between Akasha and the latitude of Kosha the country becomes
less confined, but contains several high and precipitous hills.
South of Kosha it becomes more and more open, and the hills lower
and more scattered until they appear to die away south of
Kerma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>From Kerma, as far
as Old Dongola, practically no hills are visible from the river,
and the sand hills are piled up on the very edge of the water. At
Old Dongola the ground rises, and from there, as far as J. Barkal,
near Merowe, rocky elevations approach the river here and there, or
are seen in the distance, without, however, always encroaching on
the fertile belt on the right bank.</p>

<p>From J. Barkal to Abu Hamed there is a rough and rocky belt of
hills a few miles from the river, though the elevations are
inconsiderable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage.</span>Rain falls at long
intervals in very heavy and local showers. From the upper part of
the country it is carried off by a number of wide shallow wadis,
whose beds are hardly distinguishable when crossed, though the
slight remains of grass they sometimes contain show them up clearly
when looked down on from the top of a hill.</p>

<p>As these wadis reach the rocky belt along the river, their beds
contract so much that after heavy rain regular torrents descend
them, sweeping away anything they find in their path. Much damage
occurred in this way to the camp at Akasha in 1896, though no rain
fell in the vicinity.</p>

<p>South of the crest of the spur the chief drainage lines are the
two Wadis Keheli, one of which rises near J. Kuror and joins the
Nile, about 40 miles below Abu Hamed; the other rises near No. 5
Station and is followed by the railway under the name of Wadi Gaud,
and eventually reaches the Nile a little west of Mograt Island.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vegetation.</span>Some of the wadis
contain a little grass and a few stunted selem bushes, but there is
no grazing for flocks except within a few miles of the Nile.
Firewood also is very rarely met with.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The riverain
inhabitants graze their flocks a few miles into the desert. Besides
these shepherds there are no inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>There is none.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>Except in the hilly belt
along the river, camels can go anywhere.</p>

<p>The only track at all well-known is that from Dongola (Naui) to
Merowe, cutting off the great bend of the Nile to the south.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s1b"></a>(<em>b</em>) <span class="sc">Country East
of Halfa-Abu Hamed Railway, or âThe Atbai.â</span></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Limits.</span>The Atbai is roughly the
name applied to the country bounded on the north by the
Kena-Kosseir road, on the south by the Berber-Suakin road, on the
east by the Red Sea, and on the west by the Nile from Kena to
Halfa, and thence by the Sudan Government Railway to Berber. It
lies, therefore, approximately, between N. lat. 26Â° and 20Â°.</p>

<p>The northern half, which is inhabited by the Ababda, belongs to
Egypt; the southern portion, inhabited by the Bisharin and the
Amarar, etc., near Suakin, belongs to the Sudan. Although on many
maps this country is generally labelled âNubian Desert,â much of it
is by no means desert in the true sense of the word. Comparatively
little is known even now of the more southern districts<a id=
"FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
of the Atbai, and the following descriptive notes must be taken to
apply chiefly to the country between north lat. 21Â° and 22Â°
30â².</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bisharin country.</span>The country of
the Bisharin, which is bounded on the north by an irregular line
rather north of lat. 22Â°, and to the south extends as far as
Mitateb on the Atbara, contains wide stretches of gravelly, sandy,
or stony desert, intersected by frequent bare sandstone and granite
ranges, but, at the same time, on the eastern side especially, it
contains many more or less fertile and quite luxuriantly wooded
wadis, in which water is sometimes found within 2 or 3 feet of the
surface.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage.</span>East of the railway the
hills become more frequent and larger, and the drainage lines more
conspicuous.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the watershed between the Nile and the Red
Sea, which lies between 35Â° and 35Â° 30â² E. long., consists of a
mass of hills from 30 to 40 miles in width. These hills, which
consist of agglomerations of rather small features, out of which a
bolder peak, such as J. Eigat, occasionally rises, are intersected
by very numerous rocky khors, which feed a few large and
well-wooded wadis. West of the watershed, from as far south as 20Â°
30â², all the drainage escapes north by the wadis Alagi and Gabgaba,
which unite to the east of Korosko and join the Nile near
Sayala.</p>

<p>Of these the Gabgaba has the longest course, as its head waters
rise much further south than those of the Alagi. Much of its basin
is still unexplored, in fact, the only well known portion is the
plain south-east of Murrat wells, which is painfully arid and
deficient in vegetation.</p>

<p>Many of the wadis, however, that descend to it on the east are
well wooded as long as they are in the hills, and even for a few
miles after they have emerged from them.</p>

<p>The scheme of drainage here is exactly the reverse of that west
of the railway.</p>

<p>Instead of water-courses beginning broad and ending narrow and
deep, here they commence with narrow defined rocky channels,
gradually becoming broader, sandier, of more gentle slope, and in
many places with fine trees and much âtabasâ grass. When the hills
are left, however, the trees die away, the grass disappears, and
the bed becomes ill-defined or completely lost. South of the
parallel of Murrat the country appears to become more open, and
probably very wide plains exist with little to offer to even a
desert Arab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>South of the
Gabgaba Basin, the drainage from the watershed descends nearly due
west by several large wadis, which have at various times given
trouble to the railway. Owing to the outcrop of rocks near the
river between Abu Hamed and Berber, the beds of these wadis become
restricted as they approach the river, with the usual result as
regards spates and floods.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage east of watershed.</span>On the
east of the watershed the wadis, after leaving the hills on which
they rise, traverse a range of granite hills, and thence flow,
generally in a north-east direction, to the maritime plain of the
Red Sea.</p>

<p>The principal wadis, from north to south, are Hasium, Di-ib, and
Haieit.</p>

<p>The Wadi Hasium, after emerging from the hills of Abu Hodeid,
skirts the Kajoj and Musa ranges, which it leaves some distance to
the south, and flows through open country to the sea. It contains
the wells of Kajoj and Shalatein.</p>

<p>The Wadi Di-ib, perhaps the most important wadi of the Eastern
Atbai, rises in the Amarar country, probably as far south as the
20th parallel, and flows generally northwards. About 20 miles
before it turns eastwards to traverse the open maritime plain, it
opens out into a wide basin, a mile in breadth and 8 to 10 miles in
length, containing a bed of rich alluvial soil. This basin forms
the principal cultivable land in the Um Ali Bisharin country. It is
the property of the Shantirab, but portions are allotted both to
the Amrab and Belgab in good years. An important tributary on the
left bank of the Di-ib is the Wadi Hufra, which, rising in the
Amrab country in the hills to the north-east of Onib, joins it at
the north end of the J. Elba range. It receives all the drainage
from the hills of the southern Belgab country by the Wadis Is and
Legia. At several places in its bed, the Arabs cultivate and obtain
good crops of dura.</p>

<p>Wadi Haieit, in the southern Atbai, is also said to be
cultivated.</p>

<p>The ranges of Elba and Asotriba are composed of red granite,
whilst at the foot of the latter are small hills of very beautiful
hornblende porphyrite.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate of the Atbai
is probably the best in the Sudan. The air is of absolute purity,
and the elevation, 1,500 to 3,000 feet above sea level, very
considerably mitigates the shade temperature. The heat of the sun,
however, is intensely fierce in warm weather, owing to the glare
from the sand and rocks. During the summer, waves of superheated
air are occasionally known, such as that which destroyed a convoy
on the march from Korosko to Abu Hamed in 1897.</p>

<p>In winter, the cold is quite severe, and anyone proposing to
travel there in December or January should make sure he has plenty
of bedding and warm clothes.</p>

<p>Though it is essentially a very dry climate, dew falls at
Deraheib on the west of the watershed in December, and a misty
haze, which seems to be connected with moisture in the air,
frequently covers the whole country. The climate of the littoral
is, as may be supposed, much warmer than that of the interior.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rainfall.</span>The rain falls in violent
local showers during the months of July and August, called the
âShutiâ rains. In exceptional years, showers occur in May and
June.</p>

<p>Many places go without rain for several years in succession, but
during the above-mentioned months it is always risky to camp in the
bed of a wadi, as a spate may come down, though no rain nor clouds
have been visible to the traveller.</p>

<p>The dew is very heavy on the littoral, and suffices to keep the
bush grazing in good condition, though it is insufficient to raise
the short grass, which sprouts after rain, and which forms the
principal pasture for sheep.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Towns or Villages.</span>There are
nowadays no towns or villages in the Atbai. The Arabs live by
families in groups of tents made of dom-palm matting. These, of
course, move according as it suits them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Deraheib.</span>There are, however,
throughout this district, the remains of quite large stone-built
villages, formerly inhabited by the miners of the ancients. Those
at Deraheib are particularly striking. Deraheib (Der â castle,
aheib â beautiful) was evidently at one time the seat of a colony
of miners. On the right bank of the wadi are the broken walls of
500 or more houses, arranged in streets. The castle, a large square
building, stands under the hills on the left bank. The pointed
arches of the castle and portions of some of the houses are set in
lime. The majority of buildings, however, are constructed of stone
and mud.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vegetation.</span>The vegetation,
generally, is rare and scanty, though in some of the large wadis,
even west of the watershed, it is surprisingly luxuriant. Perhaps
the Wadi Alagi, with its fine sayal and heglig and abundant marakh,
arak and other green trees, is the most striking instance. West of
the Gabgaba, and immediately east of it, selem is chiefly met with,
but as one ascends the wadis one comes on sayal and the rare palm,
â<i>Medemia argun</i>.â</p>

<p>The latter is especially numerous in the Wadis Abaraga and
Terfaui, and is found in many other khors in the neighbourhood,
especially in those descending from J. Rafit to the Gabgaba.</p>

<p>No adult specimens were noticed east of the Wadi Abaraga, though
there are many young plants trying to sprout at Abu Tabag.</p>

<p>This palm is largely used for mat-making, and the Arabs are
fully alive to the advantage of preserving it, as well as other
trees.</p>

<p>The grazing is not confined to the actual beds of the wadis.
There are many flat or depressed places where, for some months
after good rain, excellent grazing is found for camels, sheep, and
goats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>The rainfall,
however, is so uncertain that it is impossible to rely on finding
grazing at any particular place even if it has been found there in
previous years.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vegetation east of watershed.</span>The
vegetation along the wadis flowing towards the sea varies
considerably from that found along those emptying into the Nile.
Large trees, such as sayal, selem, heglig and tundub are found
along the former, as well as a bush called âadlib,â which camels
are extremely fond of, âarad,â an acacia, growing on the tops of
the granite hills that border the littoral, is used by the Arabs to
produce the red dye for the leather of sword scabbards, etc. The
medicinal qualities of the small undergrowth and grasses of the
eastern Atbai are considered by the Arabs far more efficacious than
those of the west. A species of gum tree, similar to the â<i>Ficus
elastica</i>,â but with a smaller leaf, exists on the hills of the
eastern Atbai; it is known by the Arabs as âgemmeiza.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>Water is scarce
throughout the whole district and, where found, is in many places
more or less brackish.</p>

<p>The only wells that have been sunk by the present Government are
at Nos. 4 and 6 stations, at both of which a plentiful supply is
obtained at less than 100 feet depth.</p>

<p>The ordinary water supply consists of regular wells, stone lined
for part or all of their depth, rough excavations in the beds of
wadis, and accumulations of rain water in cracks or hollows in the
rocks. These latter, which are called âmakhzans,â if large, and
âgammam,â if small, contain the best water. Those on J. Rafit are
particularly well known, and were drawn on for the supply of the
garrison of Murrat before the re-conquest of the Sudan.</p>

<p>The largest supply of water is perhaps found in the Wadi Murrat
close under the old fort. This, in the pre-Dervish days, was the
midway halting place of caravans proceeding from Korosko to Abu
Hamed, and very large numbers of camels used to be supplied from
the wells at this place. The water is brackish and disagreeable,
but drinkable.</p>

<p>Like the Murrat Wells, most of the wells in the Atbai are
situated in the beds of wadis and khors, and are consequently
filled in every time a flood descends, entailing great labour on
the inhabitants, who have to clear them out. This is especially the
case with those which are not stone lined. (A list of wells is
given on <a href="#Page_92">page 92.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>As may be supposed,
the Atbai is not a great agricultural district. In years of good
rainfall, however, there is a considerable amount of dura
cultivated in the Wadis Alagi, Gabgaba, and Di-ib, etc., but the
Arabs rely chiefly on Aswan, and to a lesser extent on Halaib and
Suakin for their grain supply. At the former town they find a ready
sale for their sheep, which command good prices. The price of a
sheep at Aswan is about PT.75, at Suakin PT.25, whilst dura at
Aswan only costs from PT.40 to PT.70 per ardeb, whereas at Suakin
it is oftener nearer PT.150. Aswan is, therefore, the most popular
market with the Arabs of the Atbai.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>The one main road through
this country, that from Korosko to Abu Hamed <em>viÃ¢</em> Murrat,
which used to be the artery through which the commerce of the Sudan
flowed to Egypt, has fallen into disuse since the construction of
the railway, and there are now no other tracks except those made by
the Nomad Arabs.</p>

<p>The nature of the country, consisting as it does of masses of
very small features intersected by numerous khors, and often
separated by plains of considerable extent, lends itself to great
freedom of movement in almost all directions. The absence of
regular trade, too, has militated against the formation of
stereotyped routes, and the result is, that between any two places
you can find at least one and very often several more or less
different routes, none of which, unless lately passed over by a
large party, would appear to the traveller more frequented than the
others.</p>

<p>The hilly mass forming the watershed is so far an exception that
camel transport from one side to the other is restricted to a few
passes.</p>

<p>The tracks, as a rule, are bad and stony; camels, even those
bred in the country, soon suffer from sore feet. The tracks usually
follow the wadis.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Minerals.</span>That this country was
once, to a certain extent at any rate, rich in gold, is evident
from the numerous shafts and traces of former workings that are
seen.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>The following species of game
are found in the Atbai:â</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Ariel: scarce on Wadi Di-ib, but south of Darur,
plentiful.</li>

<li>Gazelle (<i>Isabella</i> and <i>Dorcas</i>).</li>

<li>Ibex: on hills adjoining littoral.</li>

<li>Cony (native Halidob): hills Red Sea to Murrat.</li>

<li>Wild ass: Onib to Di-ib.</li>

<li>Wild sheep: rare, in hills from Aswan to Abu Hamed, and along
the Nile from Murrat to Akasha. Well known to exist at J. Rafit and
East of Gabgaba.</li>

<li>Klipspringer and Dig-Dig: hills adjoining littoral south of
Bowarti.</li>

<li>Cheetah and leopard: rare in hills near littoral.</li>

<li>Hyena and wild dog <span class=

<p>North of these hills are a series of large khors which drain
first north and north-east. Lower down these khors are practically
unknown, but are said to curve eastward and reach the sea north of
Cape Elba. The largest of these khors are Mahaleit, Dirab, and
Haieit. In their upper portions they are broad level valleys
covered with a considerable amount of coarse grass. The scrub in
them is low and scattered.</p>

<p>South of Wadi Amur the watershed lies north and south in about
E. long. 37Â° 20â², until the great Khor Arab basin is reached.</p>

<p>Of the wadis draining westward, south of lat. 20Â°, Khor Arab has
by far the largest drainage area. It includes in its lower portion
not only Khor Arab proper, but also Khors Erheib and Thamiam and
Barameyu. It may be said to drain the whole triangle of country,
whose angular points are Kokreb, Erkowit, and Oi.</p>

<p>Between Khor Arab and Wadi Amur the drainage is taken by Khors
Habob and Laiameb, while Khors Misrar and Aderot drain the country
between Khor Arab and the Tobrar range.</p>

<p>On the east side of the hills the valleys are narrower and have
a steeper fall, and possess well-defined and clean-swept
watercourses, which, in the narrower valleys, cover the whole bed
of the valley.</p>

<p>The most important of the khors draining west are Khors Garar,
Arbat, Okwat, and Adit.</p>

<p>The general course of Khors Garar and Okwat is at right angles
to the watershed, and the upper parts of these khors are therefore
steep and stony. Khors Arbat and Adit lie parallel to the watershed
for a considerable part of their length.</p>

<p>Khor Arbat is the largest of these khors, and, from its
watershed, opens out almost immediately into the broad Odrus plain,
which the Berber-Suakin caravan road crosses.</p>

<p>Entering the Akareirirba hills, it narrows in, and in the lower
part of its course it becomes a defile shut in by steep hills,
which rise directly from the sandy and stony bed of the
watercourse.</p>

<p>Khor Adit also has its maximum width in its upper part between
Sinkat and Jebel Erba, and, narrowing as it descends, joins Khor
Okwat through Khor Totali, a winding defile shut in by steep hills,
and in places only 200 yards wide.</p>

<p>The minor khors which drain eastward from the hills bounding
Khors Adit and Arbat, are steep stony valleys, ending in agabas,
strewn with boulders and difficult of passage by loaded camels.</p>

<p>Such are Khors Adaia and Bengar, leading from Khors Arbat and
Khors Teiutelri and Abent from Khor Adit.</p>

<p>The khors become ill-defined on leaving the hills, and what
vegetation they possess gives place to the low scrub and coarse
grass of the maritime plain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The higher parts of the
watershed on the eastern side have a perfect winter climate, and
the extreme ranges of the temperature are less than those of the
higher plains of the northern Atbai.</p>

<p>On clear nights in the late autumn and winter a very heavy dew
falls, quite sufficient to saturate any bedding or kit left exposed
to it.</p>

<p>On the west side of the watershed little or no dew falls.</p>

<p>To the west of the hills the rainy season coincides with that in
the Nile Valley, while in the east rain may be expected between
November and March, although local thunderstorms may occur at other
times of the year.</p>

<p>The winter rain in the western hills is sometimes heavy thunder
rain, and at other times a heavy downpour or thick mist,
unaccompanied by electrical disturbances.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vegetation.</span>In the lower parts of
the khors, where they merge into open desert, the vegetation is
very scanty. It is confined to a thin line of scattered scrub which
marks the lowest part of the valley.</p>

<p>As the valleys become narrower and more marked the trees are
larger.</p>

<p>Selem, samr, and tundub, form the chief part of the vegetation,
with gamob in Wadi Amur and a thick belt of âeitilâ in Khor Arab,
near its junction with Khor Oi.</p>

<p>In the valleys east of the watershed the trees are larger and
more numerous. Khor Adit is especially noticeable in this respect,
with its large gemmeiza trees near Sinkat well, its thick covering
of arak bush along the bed of the valley, and sunt and other trees
of considerable size near the watercourse. The steep and stony
khors, however, such as Khor Garar and the upper part of Khor
Okwat, are in most places swept too bare of earth to allow of the
growth of trees of any size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>The grazing on
both sides of the watershed is confined to the actual valleys.</p>

<p>The watersheds dividing the westward-flowing khors are low rough
ridges of black rock and gravel, and are practically destitute of
vegetation.</p>

<p>After rain, there is frequently grazing in the depressions in
the atmurs, such as El Gura, near Tendera.</p>

<p>In the khors on the east of the watersheds there is little or no
grass until the lower levels are reached, except in the Odrus plain
and in the upper part of Khor Adit, near Sinkat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>Throughout the whole
stretch of desert, between the hills and the railway, water is
scarce.</p>

<p>Besides those at the well-known halting places on the
Berber-Suakin caravan roadâObak and Ariabâthe following wells may
be noted:â</p>

<p><span class="sc">Garafab</span>.â50 miles N.N.E. of Abidia, has
several shallow wells among sand dunes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sararat Well</span>.âIn Wadi Amur, is 96 miles
from Garafab. The well is 50 feet deep, and is lined with stone,
but only gives a small supply. This well is probably the same as
that marked on the older maps as the âOasis of Amur.â South of the
Suakin-Berber road the chief wells are as follows:â</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tendera</span>, <span class="sc">Mib</span>,
and <span class="sc">Oi</span>.âThere are several good wells at
each of these places.</p>

<p>The Mib wells are specially good, and lie in a hollow of the
hills, reached by a narrow defile about Â¾ of a mile long. The water
supply at Thamiam is very good, but the wells are dug in the bed of
the khor and are liable to fill up. There is sometimes water in the
rocks at Rauai, but it was stated not to be sufficient to water a
hamla of 80 camels in November, 1902.</p>

<p>Talgwarab is only a water hole 18 feet deep, and cannot be
counted on as a supply at present. The natives state that attempts
to dig down deeper are prevented by the light soil falling in.</p>

<p>Near the watershed the wells are more numerous. There are four
wells in the upper part of Khor Haieit, and several others in the
deep valleys through which the larger khors drain into the Haieit,
Amur, and Arab basins. In the upper part of Wadi Amur, above
Sararat, wells are reported to be about 11 miles apart. On the
eastern side, besides the existing wells, water could probably be
found at a depth of a few feet anywhere in Khor Arbat. The wells in
the lower parts of the khors are frequently brackish. Hoshiri at
the foot of Khor Okwat is an example of this.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>In years when the
rainfall is good there is a considerable area under dura
cultivation in Khor Arab near Talgwarab and between there and
Thamiam wells. The natives build numbers of horse-shoe shaped dams
to retain the water and keep it standing on the ground. There are
also signs of the main khor channel having been dammed to divert
the water over the flat earthy soil of the valley.</p>

<p>The upper stretches of Khors Barameyu and Erheib and Hareitri
are also used for dura growing.</p>

<p>There is also cultivation near Abu Goloda, on the eastern side
in the head of Khor Haieit, in Khor Adit above Sinkat, and
especially in the Odrus Plain, dura is grown.</p>

<p>Near the Atbara River there is a considerable area under
cultivation in Khor Abadar.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>Besides the main
Berber-Suakin caravan road there are well-marked roads leading to
Rauai well.</p>

<p>The Tendera-Mib-Oi road is also a good track and the surface is
fairly smooth, except at the approaches to Mib and Oi wells.</p>

<p>The going on the main Suakin-Berber road is distinctly bad in
several places, notably at the head of the Kokreb valley, in Wadi
Hareitri and in Khor Hadasana.</p>

<p>Near the hills, communications parallel to the watershed are
difficult, as for instance between Haieit and Kokreb. Such a line
is very hard on camels, as there is a continued succession of
deep-cut khors of varying size divided by hills or ridges of loose
shale and black rock, steep and difficult to surmount.</p>

<p>The road leading from Khor Haieit to Khor Garar is a fairly easy
one for camels, but Khor Garar itself is very rough.</p>

<p>The chief routes across the watershed are:â</p>

<p class="space-above1">From Khor Barameyu to Sinkatâhere the
gradients are very easy and the surface smooth.</p>

<p>A route westward from Sinkat towards Abu Goloda and Rauai has
steep stony âagabas.â</p>

<p>From Abu Goloda into the Odrus plainâeasy slopes but rough
underfoot in the upper part of the Abu Goloda khor.</p>

<p>Wadi Hareitri on the Berber-Suakin roadâvery rough
underfoot.</p>

<p>From Wadi Amur into Khor Yudibâmany low rough watersheds have to
be crossed, and there is no beaten track.</p>

<p>From Khor Arbat the maritime plain can be reached either:â</p>

<p class="space-above1">(1) By the Tamabaf watershed into Khor
Okwat.</p>

<p>(2) By Khor Dimm.</p>

<p>(3) By Khor Adaia or Khor Bengar.</p>

<p class="space-above1">Of these the Tamabaf and Khor Dimm routes
are easy for camels, but Khors Adaia and Bengar have steep and
rough âagabas.â</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span><a id=
"p1c03s1c"></a>(<em>c</em>) <span class="sc">The
Bisharin</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boundaries of Bisharin.</span>The
Bisharin inhabit the desert bounded on the north, roughly, by the
Alagi and its tributaries, on the south by the Atbara, on the east
by the Red Sea from Shalatein to J. Asotriba, and thence by a line
joining Mitateb or Umbeiba on the Atbara, and on the west by the
Nile from the mouth of the Atbara to Abu Hamed, and thence by the
old trade route from Abu Hamed to Korosko.</p>

<p>The Ababda and Bisharin formerly lived a good deal further south
in the districts now occupied by the Hadendoas; both tribes moved
northwards probably about 100 years ago.</p>

<p>The Ababda by their move north, came into a more civilised
country. Their Sheikhs, through the transport needed on the
KoroskoâAbu Hamed road, came into touch with the Government and
acquired at this time great wealth, and with wealth, their numbers
increased, whilst the Bisharin of the hills, left far behind as
regards progressiveness, soon came to be despised by them.</p>

<p>The Bisharin claim descent from Bishar, the son of Kahl, who was
also the father of Abad and Amar, from whom the Ababda and Amarar
are said to have sprung.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Origin.</span>Kahl is said to have been
descended from Zubeir Ibn El Awam,<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> whose wife was a sister of
Abbas, uncle of the Prophet. They maintain, therefore, that they
are descended from the noble Koreish Tribe. In the genealogy of the
tribe, the three principal ancestors are Kahl, Bishar, and Ali
Jalan; on this all accounts seem to agree. The present generation
of Sheikhs is generally said to be the ninth or tenth from Ali
Jalan.</p>

<p>The descendants of Kahl most likely originally inhabited part of
the district now occupied by the Hadendoas, the Bisharin, and
Ababda, as stated above, having latterly moved northwards.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sub-division.</span>The Bisharin are
divided into two great families, the Um Ali and Um Naji. The former
live in the north, the latter in the south, of their country. Both
sections are named after the wives of Ali Jalan, the great grandson
of Bishar, who had the following sons:â</p>

<p><span class="sc">Aliab</span>.âThe Aliab, who are far more
numerous and wealthy than any of the Um Ali or Um Naji tribes, are
divided into the following sub-tribes: Koatil, Mallak, Hamedomerab,
Kurbeilab, and Balgab.</p>

<p>The first three named are sometimes classed together and known
as the Sararab, on account of their near common ancestry.</p>

<p>The Sheikh of the Koatil has for two generations been the
representative Sheikh of these three families; before this the
Sheikhship was with the Hamedomerab.</p>

<h5><em>Sub-tribes of the Aliab.</em>
</h5>

<p><span class="sc">Koatil</span>.âThe Koatil, under Sheikh Isa
Abdalla, are a small tribe, and poor. They live at Meshushenai and
Terfaui.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hamedomerab</span>.âSheikh Mohammed Wad Kurab.
This, again, is a small tribe, owning few camels, but good flocks
of sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Wadi Meisa, at the head of which is Bir Meisa, is where most of
the tribe are to be found during the summer. Their two wells are
Meisa and Didaut, close together in the small hills north of the
Elba red granite range.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mallak</span>.âSheikh Isa Shingeirab. The
Mallak, the third Sararab tribe, is by far the richest, and own
many camels, and of a breed which is famous among all the
neighbouring tribes. The Mallak own many wells.<a id=
"FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class=
"fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="sc">Balgab</span>.âThe next of the Aliab tribes is
the Balgab (Isa Abdalla), who live in the hills about Is. They have
never, since the time of Abdalla, the father of Isa, had a
representative Sheikh, but have always been represented by the
Sheikh of the Sararab.</p>

<p>They have good herds of camels, sheep, and goats. They do not
frequent the Aswan market as much as the other Aliab sub-tribes,
but they sell a great deal to merchants who come from there, and
buy much of their corn in good<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_92">[92]</span> years from the Di-ib. They are a wilder
people than the other tribes and very rarely leave their hills.
They are shy and difficult of approach. Their wells are Is and
Legia.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kurbeilab</span>.âSheikh Mohammed Katul. This
is a large tribe. They have many wells, generally in the small
tributaries of the upper Alagi.</p>

<p>Katul, Sheikh of the tribe, is by far the ablest man of the
Aliab Sheikhs, or, in fact, of any other of the Bisharin
Sheikhs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Compensation for murder or
wounds.</span>The traditional âdiiaâ or compensation for loss of
life among these Arabs is: for a man, 50 male and 50 female camels;
for women or children, or loss of legs, arms, eyes, 25 male and 25
female camels.</p>

<p>Wounds are assessed according to their gravity. The cause in
which murders are committed, or a wound is received, is always
taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The above amounts are the limit of compensation.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s1d"></a>(<em>d</em>) <span class=
"sc">Ababda</span>.</h4>

<p>The following brief account of the Ababda Arabs, whose country
adjoins the Bisharin, is given here, as, although with the
exception of the Meleikab section, they are under the Egyptian
Administration, they are generally said to have sprung from the
common ancestor Kahl (<em>vide</em> origin of Bisharin). Feuds,
too, between these tribes, though now less frequent, were, until
recently, of constant occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Limits. Three main-sub-tribes.</span>The
Ababda, who inhabit the Atbai from roughly north lat. 22Â° 30â²,
where they adjoin the Bisharin, to as far north as the Kena-Kosseir
road, are divided into three main sections or sub-tribes, viz.,
Eshabab, Fogara, and Shanatir.</p>

<p>(1) <span class="sc">Eshabab</span>.âThe Eshabab, which is by
far the largest and most powerful section of the Ababda, range
practically the whole way from Kena to Ongwat, and share the
Kosseir route with the Shanatir. The Sheikhship of this sub-tribe
rests with the Gubran family, of which Beshir Bey is the
representative. Beshir Beyâs residence is at Aswan; he claims to be
Nazir of the Ababda, and does not admit any common ancestry with
the Bisharin. This sub-tribe is divided into many minor
sub-tribes.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="sc">Fogara</span>.âThe most important sub-tribe
of the Fogara is the Meleikab, part of which sub-tribe belongs to
Egypt and part to the Sudan. The Meleikab in the Sudan, who are
practically a colony of those in Egypt, range from Korosko to Abu
Hamed, but considerable movement goes on between the two sections.
The head Sheikh of the Fogara is Abdul Azim Bey of the Khalifa
family; his headquarters are at Derau, in Egypt, on the Nile, north
of Aswan.</p>

<p>(3) <span class="sc">Shanatir</span>.âThe Shanatir share the
Kosseir route with the Eshabab, and also live on the river between
Aswan and Korosko. Their headquarters are at Sayala. Their
hereditary Sheikh is Bashari Bey, who belongs to the Shanatir
family. Their largest sub-tribe is the Abudiin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Feuds with Bisharin.</span>The feuds
before-mentioned are, as a rule, in connection with the wells. The
Ababda having gradually moved north, base their claims to wells,
now occupied by Bisharin, on the fact that they originally belonged
to them, despite the fact that they themselves left them perhaps
half a century ago.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span><a id=
"p1c03s3"></a><span class="sc">Section 3.âSuakin and
District</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc">Suakin</span>.</span>The
town of Suakin is built partly on an island and partly on the
mainland, connected by a causeway, called after the famous General
himself: âGordonâs Gate and Causeway.â The portion of the town on
the mainland is called El Kaf.</p>

<p>The Government offices, official, and most of the larger
civilian residences are situated on the island. Many of them are
imposing-looking buildings of coral, several stories high.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Harbour.</span>The khor or inlet of
Suakin is bordered by a reef of rocks on either side, its length
being 2 miles, and its breadth at the narrowest part, 180 yards. At
the entrance of the khor there is a depth of 25 fathoms, which
gradually decreases towards Quarantine Island to a depth of from 6
to 8 fathoms. The bottom throughout the channel is mud.</p>

<p>The harbour will accommodate about 20 vessels without blocking
the channel, though as many as 34 vessels, men-of-war and
transports, were berthed at one time during the expedition in
1884.</p>

<p>Owing to the numerous coral reefs Suakin is a most difficult
harbour to enter and to beacon adequately, and would probably never
be safe to navigate at night.<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> For further details,
<em>vide</em> âThe Red Sea Pilot.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population.</span>The population at the
present time may roughly be estimated at about 10,500
inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water Supply.</span>The water supply is
from two sources, firstly, from Shaata Wells, distant about Â¾ mile
from the walls of the town, and, secondly, from the pulsometer,
which pumps water at the rate of 12Â½ tons per hour, from wells Â½
mile beyond those of Shaata.</p>

<p>This latter water is brackish and is only used as a rule for
cooking and washing: it is sold in the town at 1 millieme per can
of about 3Â½ gallons.</p>

<p>Shaata water, on the other hand, is fairly good: it is brought
into the town in skins and is sold at 1 PT. per skin in the summer
months and rather cheaper during the winter.</p>

<p>New condensers to take the place of the old sets which have not
been used since 1900 are now (1904) on their way to Suakin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rains.</span>In the neighbourhood of
Suakin heavy rains occur at intervals from October to February,
with occasional rare storms up to the end of March. In the desert,
between Suakin and Berber, torrential rains sometimes fall about
July to September. No year passes without rain unless in the
extreme north of the Province, where very occasionally there is a
wholly dry season. In July, 1896, and in 1903, exceptionally heavy
rains took place, filling all the wells, including Obak, almost to
overflowing. The total rainfall for the 12 months March
(1903)âFebruary (1904) was 114Â·5 m.m.,<a id=
"FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
of which 12Â·4 m.m. fell in May.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Defences.</span>The part of the town
built on the mainland, is entirely surrounded by a high coral wall,
built in the old days to resist the attacks of the Dervishes. There
is also a line of outer forts about a mile beyond, but since the
suppression of Mahdism these have not been garrisoned, and there is
now only half a battalion stationed at Suakin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Time.</span>Time at Suakin is Cairo time,
not local time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Telegraph cables.</span>Suakin is
connected by Eastern telegraph cable with Aden, Suez, Perim and
Obokh, and by Ottoman cable with Jedda. Communication by land is by
land lines to Berber and Kassala.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The heat at Suakin is very
great during June, July, August and September, and the climate is
much damper than is usually the case in most parts of the Sudan.
The difference between the wet and dry bulb thermometer is often
21Â°. Sand storms are experienced during summer, when sand fills the
air for 40 or 50 miles seaward, rendering objects invisible at a
distance of more than Â½ mile.</p>

<p>In January the average daily temperature is about 77Â° and at
night about 73Â°.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Erkowit.</span>Erkowit, the summer
headquarters of the Suakin district, is an undulating plateau with
low granite hills and easy khors, about 3,000 feet above sea level,
and 35 miles from Suakin. The headquarters have now (1904) moved to
Erkowit for the third year in succession. The station consists at
present of seven houses, built of stone and mud-brick, white
washed, which are used as offices and quarters for certain of the
employÃ©s. A mess-house has been built on the slope of a hill not
far from these offices, also quarters or rest-houses, four in
number, for the Governor or inspectors or other officers. These are
all built of wood with corrugated iron roofing over felt and raised
about 1 foot from the ground on iron piping as a protection against
the white ant. This precaution has proved to be wholly successful.
There is <span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>an abundant
supply of excellent water from two wells situated in a khor in
close proximity to the Government offices.</p>

<p>Erkowit is in telegraphic communication with Suakin during the
summer months.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate of Erkowit in
the summer is dry and healthy, a striking contrast to Suakin. In
the winter, the hills are wrapped in clouds, and a drizzling mist
nearly always hangs over them. In March, the plateau and the
eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> hill slopes
are still clothed with green, the hill sides are covered with bush,
ferns, flowers of various kinds, and grass, and the plateau affords
excellent grazing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Communications with Suakin.</span>With
regard to the road communications, there are four tracks in use
from Suakin:â</p>

<p>(1) <em>ViÃ¢</em> the Sinkat Agaba and Khor Gebet; three days for
loaded camels.</p>

<p>(2) Tamaneb and Khor Arab route, at present easier for lightly
loaded camels than the following, but longer, and crossing two
agabas, 39 miles.</p>

<p>(3) The Masilli route, on which the very bad portion is fairly
short, but the route involves an unnecessary detour and is only
practicable for very lightly-loaded camels. Length, 36 miles.</p>

<p>(4) Kolkilai Route: A new road or track has been made this year
(1904) up this hillside, which rises over 2,000 feet above the
plain below, and it is now possible for hill camels carrying
average loads to reach Erkowit without difficulty by this
routeâlength 33 miles. A heavy hamla would still require to come by
routes (1) or (2).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc">Tokar</span>.</span>Tokar, the next town of importance in the
district, 56 miles by road south of Suakin, consists of a fort
(built after the defeat of the Dervishes and capture of Tokar in
1891) in which are the Government offices, Mamurâs house, post and
telegraph offices, etc. There is also a small market place, with a
few merchantsâ houses. It is situated at the mouth of the Khor
Baraka, between Jebel Shabba and Jebel Heina, two prominent
landmarks. <span class="sidenote">Population.
Cultivation.</span>The population is about 3,000. The soil of Tokar
is rich, and there are very extensive fields for
cultivationâcotton,<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> dura, dukhn, etc.âbut owing to the
uncertainty of the Baraka flood, and also to the fact that the
country yearly runs a great risk of being devastated by locusts, it
is impossible to foretell events or to form an estimate of what the
produce of the district will be. One year the harvest may be an
extraordinary rich one, the next may prove to be a blank. The
Baraka is in flood from the middle of July to the end of September,
reaching its maximum about the middle of August.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dust storms.</span>During the months of
June and July, <em>i.e.</em>, prior to the Baraka flood, blinding
dust storms prevail daily from 9 in the morning till 4 or 5 in the
afternoon, and it is impossible to see more than a few yards in
front of one. Travellers constantly lose their way and occasionally
die on the road between Tokar and Suakin. Formerly convoys and
troops moving at that time of year often suffered severe
privations.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1891, a party of cavalry were caught in one of
these storms and had terrible experiences, losing many men and
horses.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>In the winter the climate
of Tokar is dry and healthy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>There are many wells,
but the water is not of very good quality.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc">Trinkitat</span>.</span>Ras Magdam forms the northern entrance
point of the inlet forming the harbour of Trinkitat, about 10 miles
inland from which is the town of Tokar. The entrance to Trinkitat
is not easily distinguishable, as the coast is low and sandy. Off
the entrance lie extensive reefs and shoals. There is good
anchorage outside the harbour in about 6 fathoms, under shelter of
the reef named Katat Kennasha. The harbour opens to the north-east,
is about Â½ mile wide, extends Â¾ mile to the southward, has a depth
of 4 fathoms, and is capable of accommodating 20 vessels drawing
from 18 to 21 feet; the holding ground is good. The shores of the
harbour are sandy, with low bushes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sheikh Barghut (Barud).</span>About 14
miles south and Â¾ miles west from Mersa Durur, and 36 miles north
of Suakin, is the entrance to Mersa Barghut, useful as a temporary
anchorage, and which is to supersede Suakin as a harbour, and the
outlet for the trade of the Sudan. This Mersa is named after a
chief,<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a> the ruins of whose tomb on the northern point
of the entrance is a good sea-mark. The khor is formed by a gap in
the coast reef, by which it is also bordered; its north-western arm
extends inland 2Â½ miles, with depths of from 14 to 18 fathoms, mud
for 1Â½ miles, and then irregular soundings. A small vessel can go
up in mid-channel, but could not turn without using warps.</p>

<p>The western arm extends about Â½ mile, and shoals gradually;
there is a donga at its head trending more than a mile in a
south-westerly direction, in which, during the wet season, there is
fresh water, but, in the summer, only a shallow tidal drain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Directions.</span>The tomb on the
northern entrance point is more in the shape of a cottage than of
the ordinary Arab tombs, and its summit, being about 25 feet above
the sea, can be seen from the masthead of a vessel from a
considerable distance.</p>

<p>There is good anchorage in 14 fathoms near the entrance of the
north-western arm with the tomb, bearing about south-east by east.
Here there is room for three vessels of moderate size at single
anchor.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>No supplies of any kind
can be procured, but there are some springs of good water on the
southern side of the khor, about a mile from the beach. Fish may be
obtained by the score in the western arm. Game is plentiful, but
somewhat wild.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Police posts, &amp;c.</span>The remaining
stations of importance in the district are merely police posts,
consisting of a fort, garrisoned by police, with a small Arab
community living in grass tukls close by. These are: Halaib,
Mohammed Gul, and Agik,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_96">[96]</span> all on the Red Sea, and Karora, inland.
Halaib is the most northern, and is near the frontier of Egypt.
Karora is the post on the Sudan-Eritrean frontier, about 28 miles
from the Red Sea. There are about 1,000 feddans of cultivable land
between Karora and the sea on the northern side of the Sudan
boundary of which the natives take advantage, though not to any
great extent.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>In different parts of the
Suakin district the following species may be found: Kudu, oryx
(beisa), ibex, wild sheep, klipspringer, ariel, gazelle
(<i>Dorcas</i> and <i>Isabella</i>), dig-dig, hare, bustard. Lion,
leopard and cheetah are rare. There is good sea fishing at Suakin,
which is famous for its so-called lobsters, which are really large
crayfish.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Nomad Arabs and Tribes</span>.</h4>

<p>It is quite impossible to arrive at anything like an accurate
number of the population of the Arabs in this district, but 50,000
is a fair estimate. <em>Vide</em> <a href="#appf">Appendix
F.</a></p>

<p>The majority of them live right in the interior of the hills and
are constantly on the move, here, there, and anywhere, wherever
rain happens to have fallen or grazing is plentiful.</p>

<p>A journey, no matter how far, is nothing to them; their houses,
consisting simply of straw mats stretched over curved sticks, can
be put up or pulled down in a very short time. Their families,
wives, children, and belongings, are put on what camels and donkeys
they possess; cattle, sheep, goats, etc., are driven on ahead, and
so the caravan proceeds, sometimes for a whole month and more,
sometimes for only a few days.</p>

<p>The chief tribes are the Amarar and the Hadendoa, both of which
have many sub-tribes. There are also the Beni Amer, Bisharin,
Ashraf, Shaiab, Habab, Komilab, Arteiga, and Rasheida, who came
originally from Arabia and now live partly on the Atbara in Berber
Province and partly near Agik. They were until recently much
addicted to slave running.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Red Sea Littoral-Suakin District</span>.</h4>

<p>The coast of the Suakin Province extends from Suakin to N.
Parallel 22Â° on the north, and from Suakin to Ras Kasar on the
south, <em>i.e.</em>, roughly about 500 miles in all. The coast
from Sheikh Barghut to Suakin is quite low, being composed entirely
of raised coral reef, furrowed by khors which contain water only in
the rainy season.</p>

<p>There are several small inlets and creeks where dhows can anchor
all along the coast, but the chief harbours, in addition to those
already described, are as follows:â</p>

<p>At all of the above harbours, except Gezira, Abdalla, Heidob,
and Ras Magdam, fresh water can be found a short way inland.</p>

<p>Most of the entrances to the harbours are narrow, and require
careful navigation; moreover, they are in every case guarded by
coral reefs, and as they are not at present (1904) lighted, they
cannot be entered at night.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Section 4.âCountry between the Berber-Suakin
Road, the Atbara, and the Abyssinian and Eritrean
Frontiers</span>.</h3>

<h4 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c03s4a"></a>(<em>a</em>)
<span class="sc">Country between Berber-Suakin Road and latitude of
Kassala</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">General description.</span>Kassala and
Adarama are, with the exception of a few small outlying hamlets
near the former and the one diminutive Hamran village on the Setit,
the only permanent towns or villages in Sudan territory east of the
Atbara. Nearly the whole of this country, except that near Kassala
and south of it, belongs to the Hadendoas, who range from the
Atbara to Suakin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Country north of Kassala.</span>Adarama,
on the Atbara, about 78 miles above its junction with the Nile,
once the headquarters of the redoubtable Osman Digna, but now
almost deserted, consists of little more than a few tukls, and the
walls of the mud houses of the Dervish town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>The following
general description of the country between Adarama and Kassala is
taken from a report by Captain A. C. Parker, who traversed this
country in April and May, 1901.</p>

<p>âLying to the north of Kassala, and bounded on the east by the
range of hills along which the frontier is delimited, and on the
west by the river Atbara, stretches a vast plain of almost unbroken
continuity.</p>

<p>âFrom Goz Regeb to a point on the river west of Kassala the
country inland consists of, first, a broad strip of cotton soil,
sparsely sprinkled with small trees and bushes. To the east of this
there occurs a stretch of more or less sandy soil, supporting a
coarse grass and a few stunted isolated trees until the fertile
soil adjoining the Khor El Gash is reached.</p>

<p>âThis khor, after passing the town of Kassala and receiving
numerous small khors from the east, conveys its flood water in a
more or less defined channel, or in some places channels, as far as
Filik. Along its banks, north of Kassala, dom palms are replaced by
thick tamarisk or tarfa trees, which continue most of the way to
Filik, on nearing which they in turn are replaced by talh and other
thick thorn scrub.</p>

<p>âA short distance north of Filik, owing to the extreme flatness
of the country, the eastern channel disappears, and the water
dissipates itself through the soil to a distance varying according
to the volume of the flood water, its direction being roughly
N.N.W.</p>

<p>âThe opinion, still held by some, that the Gash water flows
towards the Langeb seems untenable.</p>

<p>âThe Odi plain which receives numerous small khors from the
eastern hills is probably about the same level as the Gash plain,
but there certainly appears to be sufficiently rising ground
between, though hardly noticeable, to preclude the Gash reaching
Odi.</p>

<p>âFrom Filik, following the direction of the Gash, the bushes
which define its course gradually decrease until they become as
scattered as in the rest of the plain, and all trace of its
direction is lost.</p>

<p>âThe plain still extends northwards, until at a point, said to
be not far from Jebel Safra, it receives the waters from the
Angwatiri and Godamaieb khors, which join here, and probably that
of other khors flowing in a south-westerly direction from the rocky
hills to the north-east. From these hills also many khors start in
an easterly and south-easterly direction, which finally reach the
Odi or the Langeb.</p>

<p>âFrom J. Sanai northwards, for some distance the country
consists of large ranges of hills, separated by wide valleys,
containing very often stretches of cotton soil in the wider parts,
but close to the hills the ground becomes rocky and stony.</p>

<p>âFrom these valleys, the khors, some of which are lined with dom
palms, trend in a south-westerly direction, but in nearly every
case are hemmed in by sand hills, and are thus prevented from
reaching the Atbara. The valleys, or rather basins, where the final
exit is stopped, being usually selected by the Arabs to
cultivate.</p>

<p>âOf these valleys the principal are Hegerib, Todabanob, and
Hambokeb.</p>

<p>âWells, the locality of which depend largely on the rainy season
or local thunderstorms, are fairly plentiful throughout the whole
of the country traversed by these khors, and supply water for
numerous sheep and goats, and in some places a few cattle, grazed
by Hadendoas of the Gemilab, Haikolab, Amerab, Shebodinab, and
other tribes.</p>

<p>âA small party mounted on camels may travel through this country
at any time of the year without fear of inconvenience from lack of
water. After the rains, pools of standing water will be met with in
many places.</p>

<p>âThe Gash itself, according to native tradition, has an exit to
the Atbara near Adarama, and it is very possible that the waters of
the northern Gash plain, called by the Arabs Gash Dai, may have a
channel meandering through the hills formed by the rush of water in
exceptional years.â</p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s4b"></a>(<em>b</em>) <span class=
"sc">Kassala</span>.</h4>

<p>Kassala is situated on the right bank of the Khor Gash, 1,735
feet above the sea, and lies 15 miles west of the nearest point on
the Italian frontier, which is near Sabderat. The twin Jebels,
Mokram and Kassala, rise abruptly from the plain 3 miles to the
east and south-east. The highest of the peculiar dome-shaped
protuberances of the latter is 2,600 feet above the town, and is
usually visible at a distance of 60 or 70 miles. There are several
perennial springs in the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Town.</span>Beyond the fort built by the
Italians, the barracks, and the various other Government buildings,
etc., there are few brick buildings in Kassala, as the native part
of the town is constructed chiefly of grass tukls. There are two or
three fair stores kept by Greeks, where most tinned provisions and
other small requirements are obtainable, and at least one of these
is licensed to sell liquor.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Garrison.</span>The normal garrison
consists of one regular battalion, six (late Italian) 9 cm. Krupp
guns, four Nordenfeldt, and four Gardner machine guns. In addition,
there is a battalion of Arab irregulars, recruited locally, chiefly
from Beni Amers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Hadendoas, and Abyssinians. In consists of 200 men, all of whom are
mounted on either camels or mules. This battalion rendered good
service during the late campaign, and, in peace time at any rate,
are by far the most suitable troops for this part of the country.
They are natural scouts and exceedingly mobile. A considerable
number of irregulars could be raised here at any time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sheikh El Morghani.</span>Said Ali El
Morghani, the youthful head of the Morghani sect whose home is the
Khatmia under the north-west end of J. Kassala, has now taken up
his abode at Omdurman, where, however, he is by no means so
generally revered as in the Eastern Sudan. Said Ahmed, an elder
brother, who was a prisoner during the Mahdia, now acts as his
representative at Kassala. Said Aliâs ancestors were Ashraf at
Mecca, and settled at Kassala at the beginning of the last
century.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population.</span>The population of
Kassala town in 1900 was 12,000; and the whole of the Nomad Arabs
in the district were then estimated to number 6,000. In 1904, the
total population of the town and the Nomads was computed to be
46,000. The townspeople are chiefly Halenga Arabs, who are
excellent cultivators, also a mixture of Beni Amer, Shukria,
Takruris, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply. Cultivation.</span>The
water supply, which is from wells varying from 15 to 30 feet deep,
is good and plentiful.</p>

<p>The principal cultivation is the dura crop, raised on the land
flooded<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> by the Gash. This dura is a large white species
called âTaulib,â and is harvested about January; it ranks in
quality with the best âMugadâ dura of the Nile. At present the
system of irrigation on the Gash is very primitive and wasteful. An
improved scheme in accordance with modern ideas is under
consideration.<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a> A subsidiary rain crop (Naggad), harvested at
the end of October, is also raised, but is not of much account.
Crops are very liable to the attacks of extraordinary flights of
very voracious small birds and also locusts. A very destructive
species of âblightâ occasionally devastates the crops. It is known
as âEl Asalâ (<i>Aphis Sorghi</i>, <em>vide</em> âReport of
Wellcome Research LaboratoriesâGordon Collegeâ1904â). The rains are
often barely sufficient to raise those crops dependent on them.
Gardens irrigated by sagias and wells are numerous.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rains.</span>The rainfall of an average
year is very meagre.<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a> During the Kharif, the period from June
to October, rain of any kind rarely falls on more than 20 to 30
days. On perhaps half a dozen of these there may be very heavy
thunderstorms. Rain, which almost invariably comes from the east,
generally falls between 6 and 8 p.m., and is preceded by a wind of
hurricane force, which usually brings with it a phenomenal wall of
dust several thousand feet high and many miles in extent, which
often takes an hour or more to blow past, during which time the
obscurity and colour of the atmosphere reminds one strangely of the
thickest of London fogs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate for eight
months of the year, though hot in March, April, and May, when the
thermometer not infrequently registers over 112Â° Fahr., is healthy.
From July to October there is a good deal of malaria, especially
during a favourable rainy season. This has been reduced a good deal
recently by draining, and precautions against mosquitoes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>The trade at present is not
to be compared with that before the Mahdia, but is increasing; what
export trade there is, comes from Gedaref. The imports <em>viÃ¢</em>
Suakin and Massawa are not of much importance at present; they are
sugar and Manchester goods principally. By far the largest
proportion of imports now comes <em>viÃ¢</em> Suakin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport animals.</span>The camel is the
best animal for this district, both for riding and transport
purposes. A good camel costs from Â£E.7 to Â£E.10. They are nearly
always available for sale or hire, though in the rains they are not
to be found in the immediate vicinity of Kassala.</p>

<p>Horses or mules, which are imported in small numbers from
Eritrea or Abyssinia, cannot usually be hired or purchased. Horses
are liable to be attacked by a species of horse sickness, which
often ends fatally. The Abyssinian and Dongolawi breeds do best. A
good riding mule costs from Â£E.6 to Â£E.8.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Posts and telegraphs.</span>There is a
weekly camel post for both letters and parcels to and from Berber,
also a weekly mail to and from Keren and Massawa, also a
fortnightly mail to and from Suakin, and a weekly mail to Gedaref
and Gallabat. Telegraph lines connect with Suakin, Gedaref,
Gallabat, Massaua, and Addis Ababa. Communication is liable to
occasional interruptions during the rains.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Serut fly.</span>During the âKharifâ the
whole country south of the line Kassala-Asubri swarms with a
wasp-like âSerutâ fly, which bursts into life as soon as the young
grass has sprouted and dies as the vegetation dries up at the end
of the rains. This fly is most vehement in its attacks on all
animals, including game, but camels suffer the most, and if exposed
for any length of time to their bites, they rapidly lose condition,
and will probably die from the effects.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>In various parts of the
districts, described in Section 4, the following varieties are
found:âElephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, giraffe, roan-antelope, kudu,
waterbuck, tora hartebeeste, ibex, wild sheep (?), bushbuck (two
(?) varieties), reedbuck (scarce); Abyssinian duiker, oribi,
dig-dig, and the following gazelles:âSommeringâs, Dorcas,
Heuglinâs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> Isabella,
and possibly Rufifrons; also hippopotamus, crocodile, turtle,
warthog, pig, wild ass, lion, leopard, hyena (two varieties),
cheetah, serval; also various civet and wild cats, hares, wild
dogs, baboons, and monkeys; ostrich, bustard, guinea fowl,
francolin, sand grouse, geese, snipe, wild fowl, and quail.</p>

<p>Both rhinoceros and buffalo are rare.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s4c"></a>(<em>c</em>) <span class="sc">The Khor
Gash</span>.<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a></h4>

<p>For at least 70 miles above Kassala the Gash has a sandy bed,
which averages 100 to 300 yards in width, with strips of higher
ground, covered with grass, and liable to be flooded in a good
year, bordering it at intervals, especially at the bends. Outside
these again, on what may be called the real banks, is an almost
continuous fringe of dom palms and high grass, varying from 100 to
500 yards, and occasionally nearly a mile, in width. There is no
definite track parallel to the khor on either bank, but the going
on both banks outside the belt of dom palms is good. If desired,
the bed of the Gash may be followed, though rather heavy-going, and
corners may be cut off occasionally.</p>

<p>Year after year, in the dry season, water is found in certain
well-known localities, usually 2 or 3 miles apart. The depth of the
wells, which are revetted with brushwood, varies, according to the
season and the flood, from 5 to 20 feet. The cattle and sheep are
watered usually every alternate day from large mud basins (duruk),
two or three of which are constructed near each well. There are
nowadays no places between Kassala and Todluk where water stands in
pools for any considerable time after the flood has subsided, as it
is said to have done formerly at Saneit,<a id=
"FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
where, however, water is still found very close to the surface.</p>

<p>The Gash flood usually reaches Kassala during the first week in
July, and brings down with it numerous fish, which are eagerly
caught by the natives. It ceases to flow about the end of September
or beginning of October. During the period when it is in flood it
is occasionally unfordable for several days together. The Gash,
like the Atbara, brings down a large amount of fertilising matter
from Abyssinia. The discharge of the Gash in flood is estimated at
about 100 metres cube per sec.</p>

<p>There are no permanent inhabitants living on the Gash, but in
the dry season, thousands of Beni Amer cattle and sheep, and nearer
Todluk, those of the Baria, are brought to it south of Kassala for
pasture and water.</p>

<p>Many of the Beni Amer, Baria, and Baza in Italian territory, all
of whom are bitter enemies of the Abyssinians, may be met openly
carrying Remington rifles.</p>

<p>North of Kassala the people, watering from the Gash, are
principally Hadendoas. For description of Gash, north of Kassala,
<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_97">p. 97.</a></p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s4d"></a>(<em>d</em>) <span class="sc">Country
South of Kassala to the Setit</span>.</h4>

<p>South of Kassala a flat and, except for the Gash, waterless
plain, bounded on the east and south-east by the Eritrean hills
from Sabderat to Sogada, extends to the river Setit. The whole of
this plain is more or less covered with kittr and other thorn bush,
which becomes particularly dense towards its southern and western
extremities. With the exception of the Nomads living during the dry
season on the banks of the Gash and Atbara and the few Hamrans on
the Setit, the entire country is uninhabited.</p>

<p>Though a good deal of the country south of Abu Gamal is drained
by several khors, chief of which are Gersat and Gullui which,
having their origin in the Sogada hills, or even further east, join
the Atbara at Khashm El Girba, nevertheless, the ground, being
cotton soil, becomes at intervals in the rainy season boggy, and
practically impassable, and water stands in ponds at several
places, notably Umsiteiba and Mellawiya, on the roads from Kassala
to Asubri and Fasher. At this season, too, most of the country is
covered with tall rank grass, and travelling even along the roads
is a thing to be avoided.</p>

<p>There is a perennial spring on Jebel Abu Gamal, 18 miles south
of Kassala, from where there used to be a road, now overgrown with
bush, <em>viÃ¢</em> this Jebel to Um Hagar on the Setit.<a id=
"FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
A scanty water supply is sometimes obtainable from holes in the
rock of Koraitib, 47 miles south of Abu Gamal.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s4e"></a>(<em>e</em>) <span class="sc">Country
South of R. Setit</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>Sudan territory, south
of the Setit, bounded on the west by the Atbara, and on the east
and south by the Abyssinian frontier, running from the mouth of the
Khor Royan (a tributary of the Setit) to a point opposite the Khor
Abnakheir (a tributary of the Atbara), near Gallabat, is
uninhabited, save for the one village of Gadabi, about 25 miles
north of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> Gallabat.
The people living at this village are Takruris. The village of
Nogara, which lies 10 miles S.S.E. from J. Lukdi, belongs to
Abyssinia, and is under Dejaj Gasessa (1904). Many of its
inhabitants were formerly under Mek Nimr, and are a mixture Jaalin,
Takruris, and Sudanese, the majority of whom are said to be robbers
and runaway slaves.</p>

<p>The country bordering the Setit to as far south as J. Lukdi
belongs to the Hamrans, south of them the country, including the
Bahr El Salam, belongs to the Debania, and further south again the
country, including Gadabi, belongs to the Takruris, of
Gallabat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Description of country.</span>Between the
Setit and the Bahr El Salam rivers the country is flat and
waterless, and its surface is badly cracked, cotton soil, overgrown
with high grass, and generally wooded, but with here and there wide
open spaces. South of the Bahr El Salam, though the trees, grass,
and soil continue much the same, the Abyssinian foot hills approach
nearer to the Atbara and the ground becomes more undulating and
intersected by khors, in some of which, though chiefly in the
extreme south, water stands throughout the year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>As the inhabitants are few,
roads are proportionately little used, and consequently bad and
overgrown. Off the track, the going is execrable, and grass, bush,
and cotton soil make the following of game paths a necessity.</p>

<p>All roads lead to Nogara, the asylum for illegitimate hunters
and renegade blacks from the Sudan. They are: (1) Gedaref to Nogara
(70 miles, approximate), <em>viÃ¢</em> Sofi, Geif El Hamam (on
Setit), and J. Lukdi. About 25 miles without water between the two
latter places. At Lukdi, a large well, filled with sand, requires
cleaning out; now (1904) only contains rain water for a few
months.</p>

<p>(2) Um Hagar (on Setit) to Nogara (38 miles). Water
comparatively plentiful up to December, after that only obtainable
by digging in bed of Khor Royan and Khor Bowal (17 miles interval).
The Italians hope this road will be a trade route from Abyssinia
into Eritrea. With this object in view a road has been cut by them
from the Khor Gash to Um Hagar.</p>

<p>(3) Abu Gulud to Nogara, <em>viÃ¢</em> Abu Siteib (50 miles).
Water at Tabarakalla (17 miles), also Atbara, Abu Siteib, Bahr El
Salam.</p>

<p>(4) Nogara to Gallabat (83 miles), <em>viÃ¢</em> Abu Siteib, Khor
El Dom, Gadabi, and Um Sai. Water plentiful in December, probably
scarce between Abu Siteib and Gadabi (37 miles) later. Very little
used and much overgrown.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Natural products.</span>Honey and gum are
practically the only products of this country. A good deal of game
still exists, but it has suffered both from the depredations of
cattle plague, as well as from professional game dealers with their
parties of armed natives who have hunted this district for years:
these are now rigidly excluded by the Sudan Government. The
inhabitants of Nogara are also mostly armed with modern
breechloading rifles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abyssinian outlaws.</span>Two Abyssinian
outlaws have haunted this region both during and since the Mahdia.
One, whose name is Hakos,<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> reputed to have some 150
rifles, has lately (1902) been actively raiding villages along our
frontier. Kidana Miriam, the other brigand chief, has remained
comparatively inactive, and is now (March, 1903), reported to be on
the Upper Bahr El Salam or Angareb with 50 to 200 rifles.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c03s4f"></a>(<em>f</em>) <span class="sc">The
Atbara<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a> and Tributaries</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="sc">The Atbara</span>.âThe Atbara rises near Chelga
in Abyssinia, where it is known as the R. Goang. Coal is found in
the valley of the Goang near its source. Both the Atbara and Setit
in their course through the Sudan flow for the most part through a
flat alluvial plain, and have cut for themselves a deep channel,
which is, in the upper reaches of the Atbara at any rate, over 150
feet below the level of the plain. The banks, too, have been washed
away by the drainage from either side and are cut up into numerous
ravines and khors for several miles on either side of the actual
bed.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the banks of the Atbara from Gallabat, to a
point 15 miles north of Goz Regeb, are so intersected with ravines
and watercourses, that it is seldom possible to march within 2 or 3
miles of the river, which is only approached at intervals. At
Gallabat the width of the bed, which is generally shingle, and in
which during the dry season the water stands in pools as it does
throughout its course from here to the Nile, varies from a minimum
of twenty yards at a spot where the river passes through
perpendicular cliffs of rock to an average width of 100 to 150
yards.</p>

<p>At Asubri the width between the banks, which are some 15 to 30
feet high, is about 350 yards.</p>

<p>At Gallabat (1899) the spate commenced to come down on 17th May,
and the river was still just fordable at Fasher in the same year on
the 15th June; after about that date it does not again become
fordable until the beginning or middle of November. The flood water
reaches the Nile about the end of June.</p>

<p>There are usually ferries at Sofi, Fasher, Suweihil (near
Asubri), and Goz Regeb during the flood season.</p>

<p>South of Sofi a road leads up the left bank to Gallabat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>North of Sofi,
which is on the left bank near the junction of the Setit, roads run
parallel with the river on both banks, that most generally used
being from Sofi to Asubri by the left bank, thence to the Nile by
the right bank. The country from the Setit to Fasher (right bank)
belonged formerly to the Hamrans; it is now practically uninhabited
except by Nomads during the dry season. Fasher to Mitateb (right
bank) belongs to the Hadendoas, who go there in large numbers for
grazing during the dry season. Their country practically extends
from the Atbara to Suakin. From Mitateb (right bank) and Goz Regeb
(left bank) to the Nile the country belongs to the Bisharin. From a
point about 50 miles south of Adarama northwards to the Nile the
banks are fringed with dom palms. Few people live along the river
during the rains, and though the alluvial soil brought down by this
river is one of the chief fertilizing agents of Egypt, there is at
no season any system of irrigation in use along it. Here and there
where nature causes the river to overflow its banks a certain
amount of cultivation may be met.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tributaries of the Atbara</span>.âThese nearly
all emanate from the hilly country of Abyssinia or Eritrea. There
are none of importance on the left bank in the Sudan.</p>

<p>(1) <span class="sc">The Bahr El Salam and Angareb</span>.âThe
Bahr El Salam is a flowing stream during most of the year. Its bed
is very rocky, and in places the bends are extremely sharp as it
cuts its way through high cliffs of rock. It has many deep pools
with hippopotamus and crocodiles, and appears to often overflow its
banks in flood time in places where it passes through these narrow
gorges. It has generally a north-westerly direction. The River
Angareb appears to be only another name for the upper Bahr El
Salam. The Bahr El Salam joins the Atbara on the R.B. about 28
miles south of Sofi.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="sc">The Setit<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and Royan</span>.âThe
lower Setit, <em>i.e.</em>, that portion of it which flows through
Sudan territory, much resembles the upper Atbara in general
character. Its banks are similarly intersected by ravines and small
khors which carry the drainage from the plateau along which on
either bank there is a track at some distance from the river, and
which only descends to it occasionally. The river is generally
about 300 yards wide, and during the dry season it is fordable at
frequent intervals, and here and there almost ceases to flow.<a id=
"FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The only inhabitants of the Setit, west of the junction of K.
Royan are the survivors of the once famous Hamran sword-hunters,
who live in a small village on the right bank about 15 miles from
its junction with the Atbara. Although now very poor and with their
hunting to a certain extent restricted by the Game Laws, they have
nearly all acquired horses and are as bold and keen Nimrods as
ever. Latterly, many of the Beni Amer Arabs from Eritrea have
brought their flocks for pasturage to the banks of the Setit during
the dry season.</p>

<p>Above Umbrega there was no track on the right bank in March
1900, as the Abyssinian Baza, living east of Maietib, were said to
terrorise the country. There is now (1904) a fairly good track made
by the Italians who have a small post at Um Hagar.</p>

<p>In Abyssinia the Setit is known as the Takazze.</p>

<p>The junction of the Royan and Setit is about 4 miles east of
Khor Umbrega. The Royan appears to be merely a khor which is dry,
except for occasional pools, a few months after the cessation of
the rains. Its junction marks the boundary on the Setit between the
Sudan and Eritrea on the north bank, and Abyssinia on the south
bank.</p>

<p class="sch">CENTRAL EASTERN SUDAN.</p>

<p class="center">(Country between the Nile and Abyssinia, bounded
by the Atbara and the Blue Nile.)</p>

<h3 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c04s1"></a><span class=
"sc">Section 1.âCountry between the Atbara and the Nilesâfrom El
Damer Southwards to Abu Haraz-Sofi Line</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General description.</span>The vast tract
of country from the junction of the Atbara with the Nile southwards
to about the line Abu Haraz-Sofi, bounded on the east and west by
these rivers, and on the south-west by the Blue Nile, has been
generally called by cartographers âthe Island of Meroeâ; this name
in reality, however, has long ceased to be applied to it locally,
and is quite unknown to the Arabs of the present day. By the latter
it is divided into four districts. The northern one, forming the
triangle El Damer, Adarama, Shendi, is called <em>El Daheira</em>
(the high stony ground). The western district, including Shendi,
Halfaya, Geili, and Abu Deleig, is known as <em>El Karaba</em>;
south and south-east of this the country north of the Blue Nile
from Khartoum North to Abu Haraz is called <em>Sharg El Adeik</em>;
whilst the whole of the eastern portion from Adarama southwards,
bounded on the west by Um Hatab, El Hawad, Geili, and Galaat Arang,
forms the well-known <em>El Butana</em> grazing district.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Daheira.</span>The northern or El
Daheira district is, as its name denotes, a sandstone plateau
generally bare, level, and desert-like. On the west, there are
considerable ranges of sandstone hills. The soil, which is more
sandy than further south, is, as a rule, poor and unfertile, except
in the wadis, a few of which are usually cultivated in favourable
years, and are generally marked by stunted selem and kittr bush.
<span class="sidenote">El Karaba and Sharg El Adeik.</span>Further
south, in the El Karaba and Sharg El Adeik districts, there is much
more land suitable for cultivation, though even here it is
generally seen in the wadis only, notwithstanding that the rainfall
is markedly heavier. Selem, kittr, samr, sayal, and tundub trees
grow plentifully, though they are rarely thick enough to obstruct
free passage through them, and homra and maheirib grass are
everywhere to be met. In the two last-named districts wells are
comparatively numerous, though often excessively deep, occasionally
as much as 250 feet, and the water rather salt.</p>

<p>In El Karaba, saltworks are frequently seen. Hafirs or tanks for
holding up rain water, many of which are said to have been made by
the ancients, are here particularly numerous compared to other
parts of the Sudan, and are quite a distinctive characteristic of
this part of the country.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Butana.</span>The region known as âEl
Butanaâ is wonderfully open and flat, indeed, so much so, that, as
a rule, not a single tree or bush is visible for miles, except
along an occasional wadi. These, as a rule, drain northwards, and,
as elsewhere in this part of the country, are usually the
localities selected for cultivation, though the soil, generally
speaking, is here richer than in the other districts.</p>

<p>The great product of El Butana is, however, Hantut grass and
Siha plant, both particularly good for camels, and thus during the
rains it was, and is still to a lesser extent, customary for
camel-owning Arabs from all parts of the Sudan to visit this
district for grazing. Water at this time of year, being
comparatively plentiful, the Arabs are not tied down to the very
limited number of wells existing in the dry season, and are thus
free to wander far and wide wherever it suits them. A month or two
after the cessation of the rains the grass becomes dry,
weather-beaten, and broken, and the greater part of this region is
then bare and desolate.</p>

<p>Though the Shukria are probably the rightful owners of this
district, yet the Debania (Gedaref), Abu Rof, Kenana, Kawahla (Blue
Nile), and other tribes were always accustomed to graze here
gratuitously, though without, it seems, the permission of the
owners, who apparently were not strong enough to effectively resist
this invasion. An arrangement has now been made by the Government
assigning specified areas to the various tribes for grazing
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wells.</span>The principal localities,
and, in fact, the only known wells where the Nomad Arabs congregate
during the dry season, are given below. At all these places the
Arabs live by families in small groups of dom-mat tents.</p>

<p>I. <span class="sc">Um Hatab</span>.âAbout 30 miles east of
Kabushia, 10 wells, 36 feet deep, less in the rains. Arabs here are
Fadnia, Kawahla, and Jaalin, under Sheikh Mohammed Suleiman.
Belongs to Shendi District of Berber Province. Last wells on road
from Gedaref to El Damer. It is just outside the north-west limits
of El Butana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>II. <span class=
"sc">Um Shedida</span>.âSome 30 miles east of Um Hatab. 30 wells,
36 feet deep. Arabs and Sheikh same as Um Hatab, belong to Berber
province. Situate in north of El Butana.</p>

<p>III. <span class="sc">Bir Ambasa</span>.âBetween Abu Deleig and
Um Hatab, is said to be 300 feet deep, water plentiful. However, no
Arabs live here, presumably on account of the great depth of well
and consequent labour in drawing water. It is said to have been dug
by the Ancients (infidels), and to have inscriptions on it, though
this appears open to doubt.</p>

<p>Bir Geheid about 20 miles east of Ambasa and on the eastern side
of El Hawadâa very large well, 30 feet in diameter and 330 feet
deep. No water at present and well partially filled in. Said also
to have been built by the Ancients.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="sc">Debbaghat</span>.â16 wells, 60 feet deep,
in Khor Jegjegi. Lies about 6 miles E.N.E. from Abu Deleig. Arabs,
Jaalin, Ahamda, Batahin, under Hassan Nimr, a sub-Sheikh under
Mohammed Suleiman. It belongs to Berber Province.</p>

<p>V. <span class="sc">Isnabir</span>.â23 miles east of Abu Deleig,
on road from Goz Regeb to that place. Arabs, Batahin, under Sheikh
Mohammed Talha, belonging to Gezira Province. Wells contained
little water in April, 1900.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="sc">Abu Deleig</span>.â84 miles by road E.N.E.
from Khartoum. 50 wells, 30 to 70 feet deep, extending for some
miles in the Wadi Jegjegi. Headquarters of the Batahin and
residence of Sheikh Mohammed Talha. Other tribes here are Mogharba,
Hassania, Jaalin, etc.</p>

<p>Abu Deleig belongs to Gezira Province, and there is a Mamur,
Police Officer, and Police Post here.</p>

<p>Up to February, 1898, Abu Deleig was always held by a Dervish
force, latterly under the command of Abd El Rahim Wad Abu Dugal.
This post was surprised by Irregulars from Kassala in February,
1898, who in turn, however, were themselves surprised on their way
back to Kassala and suffered severely.</p>

<p>VII. <span class="sc">Geili</span>.âAbout 25 miles due south of
Abu Deleig. About 30 wells, 100 to 150 feet deep, situated around a
flat topped granite hill about 250 feet high, on the summit of
which is the tomb of Bint El Mek, a daughter of one of the Fung
kings and wife of one of the early Shukria sheikhs. Arabs, Batahin
and Mogharba, belonging to Gezira Province. There are ancient
carvings here on the south side of the hill. (<em>Vide</em> also

"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74585/74585-h/74585-h.htm#route14">
Chap. IV</a>).</p>

<p>VIII. <span class="sc">Um Rueishid</span>.â50 miles south-east
of Abu Deleig on the road from Kassala to Khartoum, three wells,
100 feet deep in the dry season. They are the westernmost wells in
the Kassala Province. Arabs Shukria, Mogharba, and Awaida, under
Shiekh Ali Wad El Had.</p>

<p>IX. <span class="sc">El Geleita</span>.â12 miles north of Um
Rueishid, on Goz Regeb-Abu Deleig road. Eight wells, 70 feet deep,
water plentiful, Arabs mostly Shukria. Belongs to Kassala
Province.</p>

<p>X. <span class="sc">Shag (El Walia)</span>.â12 miles east of El
Geleita, first water after leaving Goz Regeb, on Abu Deleig road.
Four wells, 70 to 100 feet deep. Inhabitants chiefly Shukria, few
Mogharba, etc. Belongs to Kassala Province.</p>

<p>XI. <span class="sc">El Sofeiya</span>.â72 miles rather north of
west from Asubri. 20 wells, 100 feet deep, water plentiful. Arabs
same as at Um Rueishid. Residence of Ahmed Mohammed Abu Sin, wakil
of Head Sheikh of Shukria in the Kassala Province.</p>

<p>XII. <span class="sc">Rera</span>.âAbout 10 miles south of El
Sofeiya, 10 wells, 100 feet deep. In the eastern and highest ridge,
of which there are several close by, there are two or three rock
tanks containing water. Arabs, Shukria, Mogharba, Awaida, etc.,
under Ali Wad El Had, of Kassala Province. 48 miles south of Rera
is the well of El Adeid a few miles south of J. Tawal. Water is
scarce in the dry season, and only a few Shukria are found
here.</p>

<p>XIII. <span class="sc">El Sadda</span>.â22 miles south-east of
Rera, 20 wells, 90 feet deep, Â¼ mile west of south end of J. El
Sadda, a low ridge running north and south; Arabs and sheikh same
as at Rera. From here a road leads to Gedaref, which lies about 90
miles S.S.E. No water on the road except during rains at Hafir El
Igl.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>The Arabs cultivate
considerably in favourable years, when dura can be purchased at
PT.25, or even less per ardeb. As before stated, the wadis known
locally as âAtmursâ are the localities selected for cultivation;
the chief of these being El Hawad (12 miles east of Abu Deleig),
which extends probably some distance to the south, and northwards
it trends towards the Nile at Kabushia. It receives the water of
Khor Jegjegi. âHemeisiâ and âFeteritaâ dura are the crops most
generally grown.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Herds, etc.</span>All these Arabs own
large numbers of sheep and goats, but cattle and camels are now
comparatively scarce, owing to the depredations of the Dervishes.
The Shukria camels are remarkable for their size and carrying
capacity, but are not, as a rule, suitable for fast work.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Riverain population.</span>Along the left
bank of the Atbara, from El Damer to Goz Regeb, the Arabs are
chiefly Nomad Bisharin and Jaalin. There are few permanent villages
south of Adarama.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Atbara.</span>Amid the ruins of Goz Regeb
live the few survivors of the former inhabitants under Sheikh Gaffa
Ageil. South of Goz Regeb are Shukria, under Amara Abu Sin, who has
a permanent village at Gandaua, a few miles north of Asubri.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Fasher are the Lahawin, a tribe which
formerly belonged to the White Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nile.</span>Along the Nile (right bank),
from El Damer to Khartoum North, there is a considerable and much
mixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> riverain
population, for the most part living in mud-built villages, and
cultivating with both sagias and shadufs. The chief tribes are
Jaalin, Ababda, Shaigia, Hassania, Mogharba, Aonia, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villages on the Nile.
(R.B.)</span><span class="sc">El Damer</span>.âPopulation about
700; Jaalin, etc. This town was formerly famous for its University
and learning. It suffered much during the Mahdia, but its
population and prosperity is now rapidly increasing, and there is
quite a good market; principal trade, dom-mats, baskets, etc., and
salt. A few caravans come here direct from Gedaref. There is a
railway station here. It will be the capital of the Berber Province
in 1905.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kabushia</span>.â26 miles down the river from
Shendi. Population about 250, Shaigia and Jaalin; Awaida, Aliab,
and Fadnia Nomads come here for grazing and cultivation. There is a
comparatively large market.</p>

<p>The ruins of the ancient Meroe are situated about 4 miles to the
north, and there are traces of an old temple at El Bagarawia. There
are 25 pyramids (Tarabil) about 5 miles north-east. Some of these
pyramids were examined in 1903, but little of interest was
discovered. (<em>Vide</em> <a href="#appd">Appendix D.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Shendi</span>.âPopulation about 500, majority
Shaigia and a few Jaalin also Nafiab, Awaida, and Ababda.
Headquarters of the Egyptian Cavalry: four squadrons, also one
field artillery battery. Railway workshops and good railway
station. Headquarters of Shendi District and residence of a British
Inspector, Mamur, etc. Post and telegraph offices. Excellent
climate. Houses of mud. There is a good market, but not to be
compared with that of former days, when Shendi was an important
place and had 7,000 inhabitants. The town was once the capital of
the ancient kingdom of Meroe, and is said by some to have been the
residence of the Queen of Sheba. Bruce says the women of Shendi
were noted as being the most beautiful in the Sudan. It was here
that Ismail Pasha, son of Mohammed Ali, Khedive of Egypt, was burnt
in his hut by Mek Nimr, in 1822, in revenge for his barbarities. To
avenge Ismailâs death the town and inhabitants were destroyed in
1823 by order of Mohammed Ali. The Nimr family are now in poor
circumstances.</p>

<p>There is excellent grazing along the banks of the river at
almost all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Shendi was occupied by Major T. Hickman with the 15th Egyptian
Battalion on 26th March, 1898, after a short fight.</p>

<p>Government steam engines have been erected here with a view to
cultivation by the Supply Department of the Army. The natives here
have learnt to appreciate such agricultural implements as iron
sagias and ploughs of English pattern, and are anxious to acquire
them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Wad Ban Naga</span>.âThere is a railway station
here about 24 miles from Shendi. Sauarab and Aonia Arabs, and
others, such as Deshiab Batahin, Ababda, and Hassania, come here
for grazing. It belongs to the Shendi District, of the Berber
Province. For the antiquities in the neighbourhood <em>vide</em>
<a href="#appd">Appendix D.</a></p>

<p><span class="sc">Geili</span>.âSituated on right bank of Nile,
28 miles north of Khartoum North, is the residence of Zubeir Pasha
and his following, who belong mostly to the Gemaab tribe, a branch
of the Jaalin. There are also Batahin and Hassania here. There is a
railway station at Wad Ramla, 1Â½ miles to the north.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villages on the Blue Nile.
(R.B.)</span><span class="sc">Khartoum North</span>.âOn the right
bank of the Blue Nile immediately opposite Khartoum. The name
applies to several small detached villages, such as Gubbat Khojali,
Hellet Hamad, etc. The inhabitants consists of Jaalin, Shaigia,
Mahas, Mogharba, Khojalab, etc., under Omda Mohammed Osman Ibrahim.
(For description <em>see</em> Chap. II, <a href="#Page_49">p.
49.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Eilafun</span>.âOn right bank Blue Nile, 19Â½
miles by road from Khartoum. A very neatly-kept village of Mahas
and Shaigia, under Omda Mohammed Abd El Kader. It belongs to Kamlin
district of Gezira Province. There is a mosque here, as to the
Khalifaship of which there are frequent squabbles.</p>

<p>About 7 miles east of Eilafun is the village of Um Dibban, the
abode of the three brothers, sons of the famous religious Sheikh El
Obeid, the powerful and fanatical Mahdist leader who defeated
Mohammed Ali Pasha at Um Dibban in September, 1884, and who was the
first Dervish Commander to besiege Khartoum. They have a private
mosque here, and though primarily a religious family, they aspire
to considerable temporal power.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rufaa</span>.âSituated on the right bank of
Blue Nile, 95 miles by land, by river 104 miles, from Khartoum. The
population of the town and surrounding district numbers 30,000, and
is mainly composed of Shukria Arabs. Others are Batahin, Sherafa,
Jaalin, Mogharba, etc. There is one Greek trader here who carried
on business here throughout the Mahdia. The houses are mostly grass
tukls. No post or telegraph office. Nearest is at Kamlin.</p>

<p class="center space-above15"><em>Routes.</em>
</p>

<p>Route reports referring to the principal caravan routes are
given in Vol. II, <a href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74585/74585-h/74585-h.htm#c04">Chap.
IV.</a> There is also a caravan route from Gedaref, <em>viÃ¢</em> El
Sadda, Rera, Abu Deleig, and Um Hatab to El Damer. Caravans,
however, usually strike the Nile at Kabushia after leaving Um
Hatab. From Kabushia a track leads due east to Adarama.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span><a id=
"p1c04s2"></a><span class="sc">Section 2.âGedaref and
District</span>.</h3>

<p>Practically the whole of the region enclosed between the Rivers
Rahad and Atbara from a point some miles north of the town of
Gedaref, southwards to Khor Seraf Said on the Gallabat road, an
area containing more than 11,000 square miles, is comprised in the
Gedaref District. This large tract of country, like other parts of
the Sudan, is now greatly under populated. The inhabitants of the
district are estimated at about 25,000 (1904).</p>

<p>The whole of the northern portion of this area is generally flat
and open and devoid of bush, but here and there, particularly to
north-east and south of the town of Gedaref, it is undulating and
rather hilly. As these hills extend further south, the whole
country becomes gradually enveloped in forest, which, though it
yields a good deal of gum, is practically uninhabited, waterless,
and for the most part unexplored, and bears few signs of former
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the rains, the surface of the ground, whether open or forest,
is covered with grass 3 to 5 feet, and in places 15 feet, in
height, which, until burnt, is exceedingly annoying to the
traveller, should he be on foot or riding a mule or a donkey.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the whole country is fertile, and only needs
inhabitants and a minimum of labour to render it reproductive;
water, though now scarce, would probably not prove to be an
insuperable difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Historical.</span>In pre-Mahdist days,
Gedaref and district, including the old Gedaref or Suk Abu Sin, was
a fertile and populous spot. Its cornfields supplied a large
portion of the Sudan, both to the north and west, and it was, in
short, prosperous. It was devastated by the Dervishes in 1885, and
the garrison captured. Abu Anga and later Ahmed Fedil were
appointed Emir of the district. In 1898, it was seized by a small
column from Kassala under Colonel Parsons, after a hazardous and
successful fight, a few miles outside the town, and though
subsequently twice attacked by Ahmed Fedil, held its own until
relieved by a force from the Nile. (<em>Vide</em> <a href=
"#Page_267">p. 267.</a>)</p>

<p class="center space-above15"><em>Gedaref Town.</em>
</p>

<p>The town of Gedaref is situated partly on an under-feature
emanating from some low hills, rather more than 100 feet high,
half-a-mile to the east, and partly on the plain which lies below
the general level of the surrounding country on three sides, and on
the fourth, slopes away very gradually westwards.</p>

<p>This plain, which extends for some miles in all directions,
especially to the west and north-west, is devoid of trees of any
description, and being practically all rich black cotton soil,
there is really an almost unlimited extent of land available for
cultivation during the rains.</p>

<p>The quasi-European quarter of the town consists of one street of
shops, built of brick, about 200 yards long, and, with the
exception of a few other brick houses and the Government buildings,
the whole of the remainder of the town consists of grass tukls.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>The principal traders are
Greeks, but these are few, and so far trade has not reached the
expectations formed of it, owing chiefly to want of railway
communication with this part of the Sudan.</p>

<p>There is a fair gum trade, but the quality of Hashab is hardly
equal to that of Kordofan. Otherwise, besides the usual imports,
consisting of cotton goods, sugar, etc., and the export of a
certain amount of dura, dukhn, and simsim, and coffee from
Gallabat, into other districts of the Sudan, trade at present has
not reached large proportions, but is improving.</p>

<p>It is a notable fact that in the Eastern Sudan a well-to-do
native never travels without his coffee, after imbibing which he
professes to be ready for anything; in the Gezira and Kordofan,
coffee does not seem to be nearly so generally drunk.</p>

<p>There is a little trade with Walkait, <em>viÃ¢</em> the Setit,
but this at present is insignificant.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population.</span>The inhabitants of
Gedaref, estimated in 1904 at 5,500 souls, are a heterogeneous
collection of Shukria, Debania, Takruris, and every kind of black.
The Baggaras sent here to colonise after their defeat at Omdurman
have now mostly been disseminated in the district, and what
Abyssinians were originally found here have for the most part
returned to their homes.</p>

<p>The old name of the town, âSuk Abu Sin,â is now inapplicable, as
the Shukria have so decreased in numbers and wealth during the
Mahdia as to be comparatively insignificant. Abu Sin is the family
name of the leading Shukria family.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>The water supply is
from wells partly cut through rock; it is good but not plentiful.
Efforts are being made to improve the supply.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Garrison.</span>The garrison usually
consists of one company of the Sudanese battalion at Kassala, which
also furnishes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
detachment at Gallabat. There is always an Egyptian Mamur present,
and usually a British Inspector for at least six months in the
year. In addition, there is generally a small detachment of the
Arab battalion here.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>There are many
excellent gardens, growing the usual Sudan vegetables, and in
addition, figs, limes, custard apples, and dates; the latter are
remarkable in that the trees bear two separate crops during the
year.</p>

<p>As above-mentioned, a rain-crop of dura, dukhn, simsim, etc., is
very extensively cultivated on the surrounding fertile plain; a
certain amount of cotton is also grown for local use; this, and the
cereals, are capable of considerable development; but this must
await the advent of a railway. It should, however, be borne in mind
that rain-watered cotton does not produce so fine a staple as that
grown on irrigated land. All cotton grown here finds a ready sale
at Gallabat to the Abyssinians.</p>

<p>The characteristic dura of Gedaref is a red species called
âKurgi,â which produces a very white flour. There is very little
âNaggadâ or early dura sown; its place is taken by dukhn, which,
with simsim, is harvested at the end of October, whereas the
âKurgiâ is not ripe until February. Simsim, or Sesame, as a rule
does particularly well in this district. As all crops are dependent
on the rainfall, they naturally vary considerably and in direct
accordance with it. In 1899 they were almost a complete failure.
The crops were attacked in 1902-03 by a disease called âAsal,â a
species of blight, so called as it produces a formation strongly
resembling honey (Arabic âAsalâ).<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rains.</span>The rains begin in June and
last on till October.<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a> As the surrounding country is cotton
soil, dust does not precede the storms as at Kassala, but judging
from the dilapidated appearance of the town, when revisited on
their cessation, the rainfall must be considerable in a favourable
year.</p>

<p>Unless actually seen, it is difficult to picture the difference
between Gedaref before and Gedaref immediately after the rains. By
May, the surface of the ground surrounding the houses and environs
of the town has become clean and bare, and many of the grass tukls
have been rebuilt and appear almost toy-like, so spick and span are
they. However, in October the whole place has the appearance of a
wreck, houses are tumbling down, the neat new tukls are discoloured
and distorted, and every square foot of ground, right up to the
houses, not already planted with dura, at this time fully 12 feet
high, is overgrown with the rankest of tall Aada grass, which is
even higher, and through which the by-streets of the town are mere
tunnels little more than 2 feet wide, and along which it is
difficult to find oneâs way about without a guide.<a id=
"FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class=
"fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>At this season (September
and early October) there is a good deal of malarial fever in a year
of good rainfall. The natives of the place seem to some extent
inoculated with it, though those from the more northern districts
are readily affected.</p>

<p>From December to May the climate is perfectly healthy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wood.</span>There is no building wood,
and little fire wood within 15 to 20 miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Posts and telegraphs.</span>There is a
post and telegraph office, and a weekly camel post to Kassala,
Gallabat, and Wad Medani. Telegraph also connects with these
places.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Serut fly.</span>As the serut fly is
present at Gedaref during the rains, all camels are removed about
the end of May, and other animals are kept in tukls as far as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport animals.</span>In the dry
weather camels are the best transport, both for travelling along
the roads or going across country over the cotton soil, should it
be necessary, but, in the latter case, they will sooner or later
suffer from sore feet.</p>

<p>Limited numbers of camels are obtainable for hire or purchase
during the winter months. Mules are only occasionally brought here.
As many as 50 donkeys can usually be bought without much
difficulty, price Â£E.2 to Â£E.3. The little Abyssinian donkey, price
about Â£E.2, which is the best for that country, is also generally
procurable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>Ariel, gazelle, bustard,
quail, and a few snipe and teal are to be found in the
neighbourhood at certain seasons. For game in other parts of this
district, <em>vide</em> under Gallabat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villages.</span>Beyond Gedaref itself and
the villages in its neighbourhood there are few others worth
mentioning. Sofi, on the Atbara, is a largish Jaalin village under
Sheikh Taib El Nimr. It was here that Sir Samuel and Lady Baker
spent the rains of 1869 (<em>vide</em> âNile Tributaries of
Abyssiniaâ).</p>

<p>At Abu Gulud, between Sofi and Doka, and other villages in this
neighbourhood a large quantity of grain is usually grown. Asar is
the headquarters of the Debania tribe, now much reduced in numbers,
and the residence of their Nazir Sheikh Wad Zaid.</p>

<p>On the Rahad the principal villages are Mafasa and Hawata. The
former is the headquarters of the Mamur of this (Radah) district.
Upstream of Hawata there are few inhabitants at present.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c04s3"></a><span class="sc">Section 3.âGallabat and
District</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>The comparatively small
area (about 1,200 square miles) bounded on the west by the River
Rahad, on the north by Khor Seraf Said, the southern boundary of
Gedaref Province, and on the east and south by the
Abyssinian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
frontier, comprises the district of Gallabat. Practically the whole
of this region is thickly wooded with talh, soffar, ebony, silag,
ardeib, hashab, baobab, bamboo, and other trees, of which some
attain considerable size; the central and south eastern portions
are hilly, as is Gadabi and some of the country to the east of the
Atbara.<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a> In the vicinity of the town of Gallabat there
are perennial streams of running water, but the greater part of the
province is dependent on wells for its water supply.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Town.</span>Gallabat town, called by the
Abyssinians Matemma, is situated at the foot of a steep slope on
the left bank of the Khor Abnaheir, which here constitutes the
boundary with Abyssinia, and is about 5 miles from the Atbara which
flows to the north and north-east.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Historical.</span>The town has for a very
long time been considered as forming an important trade centre on
the Sudan-Abyssinian frontier, and the latter people used to lay
claim to it. It was in consequence an almost constant source of
feuds and fighting during the greater part of the last century
between the Abyssinians and the Turks, and later with the
Dervishes. It was formerly celebrated for its slave mart, and drove
a prosperous trade. (<em>Vide</em> âCradle of the Blue Nile,â vol.
2, p. 168.)</p>

<p>It was attacked by the Dervishes under Zeki Tumal in 1886, and
sacked. Three years later King John of Abyssinia, burning with fury
at the sack of Gondar by the Mahdists, collected his warriors and
fought a tremendous battle here, with, it is asserted, 80,000 to
100,000 on either side, on 9th March, 1889. The Abyssinians, who
outnumbered the Dervishes, at first were successful, but just as
the Dervishes, on the following day, were giving way on all sides a
stray shot wounded and subsequently killed King John. This
completely reversed the situation, and the Abyssinians turned and
fled (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_258">p. 258.</a>)</p>

<p>Its occupation by the Dervishes naturally resulted in the ruin
of its trade, and this is only now beginning to revive. Robbers
are, however, rife inside the Abyssinian frontier, and owing to
that and other reasons, the revival is slow. The Anglo-Egyptian
flags were hoisted at Gallabat on 7th December, 1898, by Colonel
Collinson, C.B. The Abyssinian flag was then already flying on the
fort.</p>

<p>Gallabat is said, before the Mahdia, to have been a
comparatively large and busy trade centre. Looking at it now, it is
difficult to believe that it can ever regain its pristine wealth
and importance. The town, such as it is, with the exception of the
Zabtia, etc., is built entirely of grass tukls. On the top of the
slope overlooking the town there still remains the old Dervish fort
built by Zeki Tumal. From here a very fine view is obtained away to
the hills beyond the Atbara, and on a clear day one can see the
mountains surrounding Lake Tsana. The hill pointed out as that on
which King John was wounded lies 3 miles south-east, and that near
which his body was captured is visible 10 miles further off.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants. Takruri.</span>The
inhabitants are almost entirely Takruris,<a id=
"FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
originally from Darfur. The ancestors of these people, on arrival
at Gallabat on their way back to Darfur after visiting Mecca in the
18th century, realised they had found a better land and settled
here, where they have remained ever since. They possess curious
jagged throwing-knives, which their ancestors are said to have
brought from the Upper Congo.</p>

<p>In 1899 the population of the province, which was carefully
assessed, numbered 2,200 souls, of which about 700 were living in
the town itself. In 1901, it was estimated to be 2,670, and it has
since increased to 3,800 in 1904.</p>

<p>These Takruris are as a rule poor, but industrious and fairly
good cultivators. They also collect a good deal of honey. This they
find with great dexterity by means of a bird, whose note they are
exceedingly quick at detecting. Honey and water is always proffered
to the thirsty traveller, though a liquor called âAsalia,â a kind
of âUm Bilbilâ or âMerissa,â is the drink they prefer
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>Neither the import nor
export trade with Abyssinia has as yet attained much importance.
Coffee is one of the chief imports; this is about PT.70 per 100
lbs., and is of very good quality. The remainder are mostly
unimportant native requirements, such as bees-wax, shatta (red
pepper), tobacco, etc., which are brought in in small quantities;
also a good many cattle, horses, mules and donkeys. This import of
live-stock constitutes the bulk of the trade.</p>

<p>There is a growing export trade both in raw locally-grown cotton
as well as in Manchester goods.</p>

<p>Half the customs receipts go to Abyssinia. In 1902 the total
amounted to Â£E.720 and in 1903 to Â£E.805.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>Most of this district
is fertile, but there is little land cultivated around the town of
Gallabat, as the natives have discovered other spots in the forest
where, owing to the particular kind of grass that grows, less
labour is necessary to prepare the land for sowing.</p>

<p>Most of the cultivation lies about 15 miles north-west of
Gallabat, where there are a good many villages, chief of which are
Wallak and Basunda. Though, as a rule, the grass is almost
everywhere burnt as soon as dry (November and December), yet the
grass on a piece of land which it is intended to cultivate is most
carefully preserved until the arrival of the ensuing rains. Then,
and not till then, when the young grass has sprouted, the dry grass
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> fired, and the
old and new are destroyed together; the ground is now clear and
ready for sowing without further trouble, and thus cultivation is
carried on with a minimum of labour. As the country is mostly
forest, of course clearings have occasionally to be made. Two crops
of dura are raisedââNaggadâ and âKurgiââalso a good deal of dukhn,
which is ready for harvesting by the middle of October. Cotton is
said to grow well, and in 1901 there were 800 acres of it under
cultivation; this was four times as much as in the preceding year.
It is expected that several thousand acres will be under cotton
cultivation in 1905-6.</p>

<p>A few lime trees are now all that remain of the beautiful
gardens which existed formerly on the banks of the Khor Abnaheir.
The Dervishes are said to have ruthlessly cut down the fruit trees
for building wood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Garrison.</span>The garrison is usually a
detachment furnished by the company of the Sudanese or Arab
Battalion at Kassala. There are also the usual civil police.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rains.</span>The rains begin here earlier
and are much heavier<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> than at either Gedaref or Kassala. After
the end of April heavy rain storms become pretty frequent and last
till September or October. During this season the roads are very
bad for travelling. The serut fly appears when the new vegetation
has sprung up.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The same as Gedaref.
Healthy, December to June; unhealthy, during the remainder of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>The main water supply
is from the Khor Abnaheir, which averages 5 yards wide and 2 feet
deep, but varies considerably according to the time of year, and
becomes stagnant and foul towards the end of the dry season. There
are also some small springs near the fort, the water from which, at
this season, is more wholesome.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade routes</span>Roads lead from here
to Chelga and Gondar, Kwara, Dunkur, Roseires, Rahad, and Gadabi.
(<em>Vide</em> Vol. 2).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Telegraph offices.</span>There is a
telegraph and post office at Gallabat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport animals.</span>Camels are the
most suitable transport animals, unless the Abyssinian frontier is
crossed, when mules or donkeys become desirable; for the journey to
either Gondar or Kwara they are indeed indispensable.</p>

<p>When the Dervishes sacked Gondar, their transport consisted
chiefly of camels, but very few are said to have survived or even
to have reached there.</p>

<p>Camels are hardly ever procurable at Gallabat. No number of
mules, donkeys and horses can be relied on unless plenty of notice
is given, when the Abyssinians would probably readily supply a
limited number.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Currency.</span>British, Egyptian, or
Turkish money is not as a rule accepted by the Abyssinians, who
require to be paid in Maria Theresa dollars, which they value at
PT.10Â½, but the Sudan Government at not more than PT.9Â½.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>From El Damer to the line
Roseires-Gallabat all the game mentioned under âKassalaâ is found,
with the exception of ibex, oryx, wild sheep, and klipspringer, and
in addition rhinoceros and tiang (<i>Damaliscus Senegalensis</i>);
bohor, or reedbuck, and <i>Gazella rufifrons</i> are common in
places.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c04s4"></a><span class="sc">Section 4.âCountry between
Blue Nile, Dinder, and Rahad, with Description of these
Rivers</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General description.</span>The country
between the Blue Nile and the Rahad and Dinder Rivers is at present
(1904) practically uninhabited south of the village of Durraba on
the Dinder, which is about the same latitude as Karkoj on the Blue
Nile.</p>

<p>Before the Mahdia, villages extended along both the Rahad and
Dinder to nearly as far south as the Abyssinian frontier. Now,
however, though inhabitants are slowly returning, there are but few
villages even north of the Karkoj-Durraba line.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tribes.</span>The country lying south of
the latitude of Sennar being infested with the serut fly during the
rainy season, the inhabitants, who are principally Kenana, Kawahla,
Rufaa El Sharg, and Agaliin, are semi-nomadic; that is to say
shortly before the commencement of the rains many of them trek with
their camels, cattle, horses, etc., northwards across the Rahad to
the well-known El Butana grazing district (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_103">p. 103</a>), in order to escape the fly, whilst only a
few remain behind to cultivate their dura, simsim, and cotton.</p>

<p>The whole of this country as far south as the Abyssinian
frontier, in the vicinity of which the hills commence, is perfectly
flat and covered with bush or forest of varying density, with here
and there open spaces, often many miles in extent. The bush is
thickest in the vicinity of the river banks and thickest of all
along the Rahad.</p>

<p>The trees and bush most usually seen are talh, hashab, kittr,
sayal, kurmut, heglig, laot, sunt, sidr, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Agab Abu Gin.</span>El Agab Abu Gin,
Nazir of the Rufaa El Sharg Arabs, is in charge of all the country
bordering the Dinder and Rahad (left bank) from the latitude of
Sennar southwards. His residence is at Abu Hashim on the Dinder
(left bank). Of the other villages occupied by his people the
principal are Durraba, Bandana, Gileidat, and Lueisa.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Communications.</span>From the villages
of Wad El Abbas and Sheikh Talha, both on the Blue Nile, roads lead
to Gileidat and thence southwards along the Dinder to Durraba,
beyond which point there is no regular road. From Senga and Karkoj,
roads lead, <em>viÃ¢</em> Abu Hashim and Deberki on the Dinder, to
Hawata on the Rahad. South of this, as far as the Roseires-Abu
Ramla track, the country may be said to be roadless and, owing to
the cotton soil and bush, travelling across country is a trying
operation for man or beast. There is a good road up the right bank
of the Blue Nile from Wad Medani to Famaka.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Khor Um Degul,
or Agaliin, or Mehara, which lies between the Blue Nile and Dinder,
and joins the latter near Deberki, was formerly thickly populated
and cultivated by the Agaliin; it was, however, until 1902, quite
deserted. A few villages are now said to be springing up along it,
and wells are being opened. There are many talh and hashab gum
trees in its vicinity.</p>

<p>North of Sennar-Gileidat villages are more numerous along the
Rahad, Dinder and Blue Nile, though there is no great extent of
cultivation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>In this district, or rather
in the southern portion of it, the following species are
found:âElephant (Abyssinian variety, with small tusks), buffalo,
rhinoceros, giraffe, roan, kudu, waterbuck, tora hartebeeste,
tiang, reedbuck, ariel, gazelle, oribi, bushbuck, warthog, bush
pig, lion, leopard, hippopotamus, crocodile, etc.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">The Blue Nile</span>.<a id=
"FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class=
"fnanchor">[68]</a></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">General description.</span>The Blue Nile
rises in the Abyssinian mountains about 60 miles south of Lake
Tsana (altitude of Lake Tsana, 4,800 feet). Its source was
discovered by Bruce in the year 1760. After flowing northwards into
the lake at its south-west corner, it finds an exit<a id=
"FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
again to the south-east, and, after making a big bend to the east,
it curls round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> to
the south and flows in a north-westerly direction towards the
Sudan, which it enters near Famaka, after a course of some 500
miles. Altitude at Famaka, 1,700 feet (approx.).</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this upper portion of its course, which
has never been explored, it is believed to flow in a series of
rapids over a rocky bed and often between high cliffs, and for the
most part through the most precipitous and rugged country. Here it
is known as the Abai, whereas, as soon as it reaches the plains of
the Sudan, its name at once becomes âBahr Azrakâ or Blue Nile.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recently the Blue Nile was considered by the
Abyssinians to be the main stream of the Nile, and they, several
centuries ago, fully realised the value of attempting, or
threatening, to deprive Egypt of her water supply by the
construction of a dam at the outlet of lake Tsana or possibly
elsewhere. A mission to study the possibilities of this lake was
recently sent from Egypt, and the investigation showed that it is
by far the most suitable site on the Blue Nile for the construction
of a storage reservoir which, though its benefit to Egypt would be
slight, would be of the greatest value to the Sudan.<a id=
"FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Length, width, &amp;c.</span>The length
of the Blue Nile, from the point near Famaka, where it enters the
Sudan, to its junction with the White Nile at Khartoum, is
estimated at approximately 460 miles, which makes its total length
about 1,000 miles.</p>

<p>The average width of channel throughout its course in the Sudan
is 550 yards.</p>

<p>Although in the northern reaches the width increases, it is
rarely more than 800 yards wide at any point.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.</span>The average height of the
banks over low-water level is from 26 to 30 feet for the first 150
miles up-stream from Khartoum. Further south they are higher, and
average over 33 to 39 feet above low-water level. The difference in
level between flood and low-water is 20 to 23 feet. In the first
quarter of the year, the river is reduced to a succession of deep
pools, connected by very shallow reaches. Even native boats can
with difficulty navigate the distance between Sennar and Khartoum
during this season. The Blue Nile is at its lowest in April, but
during the latter half of May the first or false rise begins. The
real rise begins in June, and the maximum height is attained in
August. In the latter half of September it begins to fall
rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Navigability. Cataract.</span>Navigation
is simple enough at high Nile. As far up-stream as Roseires, 405
miles above Khartoum, the river is navigable by the ordinary Nile
steamers from the middle of June till the end of November. Just
above Roseires, however, there is a cataract about 6 miles long.
This cataract has never been navigated by steamer, but it is said
that previous to 1881, sailing boats passed regularly up and down
it. Rafts occasionally navigate it successfully on their way down
stream. During the last two years a small launch and a few sailing
boats have been passed up and down, but there is a dangerous reach
for sailing boats above the cataract.</p>

<p>During November and December the water falls rapidly, and
sandbanks appear in quantities, the rush of water through the
narrow channels being very great. The worst part of the river is
near Abdin and Sennar, but there is little rock anywhere. The water
for 5 miles below Roseires is bad, and in places dangerous from
rock. Steamers with barges lashed alongside, at the end of December
in most years, can get through, except at one point some 20 miles
south of Sennar, near Abdin, where a reef of rocks extends almost
entirely across the river. Steamers have to be steadied over this
place by ropes in December, and the barges passed up and down by
ropes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discharges.<a id=
"FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class=
"fnanchor">[71]</a></span>Sir W. Garstin calculates the average
discharge of the river at Khartoum to be:â</p>

</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="sidenote">Velocity.</span>The velocity of the
stream is very great: even in February it is not less than 3 miles
an hour, while in full flood it must be considerably over 6 miles
an hour. In winter the water is very clear, and of a beautiful
limpid blue. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
flood, being charged with the scourings of the Abyssinian mountains
and forests, it is heavily charged with deposit, and the water is
of a deep chocolate colour. The Blue Nile is considered the chief
fertilizing agent of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Country along the banks.</span>From
Khartoum to Sennar the country is uninteresting; banks flat,
vegetation and population considerable, here and there cultivation
by sagias, crops mostly dura.</p>

<p>South of Sennar the thorn jungle along the banks becomes very
dense, and at high Nile dips into the water; often the only way to
get through it is by hippopotamus paths, though the roads on both
banks have been cleared and there are meshras at frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the further south one goes the steeper and
higher the banks become, the channel of the river being worn away
by the rush of water. The country on the right bank is mostly
jungle, with little cultivation and few villages.</p>

<p>Between Wad Medani and Sennar the jungle on the left bank runs
in a strip of one or two miles in breadth; west of this strip are
the cultivation and villages, which extend right across to the
White Nile. Near Wad Medani the cultivation is continuous, and one
marches for miles through dura fields.</p>

<p>As one proceeds south, the cultivation becomes less general,
until south of Senga, where it is mostly confined to strips along
the river bank, and a certain amount round villages a few miles
inland. South of Senga the jungle is replaced by forest, large
tamarind trees, etc., with thick undergrowth, and open marshes
extend along the banks, which, in the dry season, afford excellent
grazing. The grass, which grows to a height of 8 to 10 feet in the
rains, dies rapidly as the rain ceases, and throughout November and
December the natives burn enormous tracts of the dry grass. These
grass fires, intended to improve the grazing as well as to enable
people to get about the country, are, as may be imagined,
exceedingly detrimental to the forest trees, which become distorted
and stunted. The forest on both banks of the Blue Nile south of
Senga is chiefly composed of acacias of several varieties, laot,
tamarisk, kittr, hashab, talh, soffar, and sidr. A few kakamut,
tebeldi, dom palms, and sycamores are also to be seen in these
forests.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The months of December,
January, and February are cool and healthy. March, April and May
are hot. The rainy season begins in May and lasts till the end of
October.<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class=
"fnanchor">[72]</a> August, September, and October are very hot and
damp. The drenching rains cool the air temporarily, but the
subsequent heat is moist and enervating. On the upper reaches at
Sennar, Karkoj, and further south, as the vegetation and foliage
increase in density, so does malarial fever abound in proportion
for at least a month after the rains have ceased. September and
October are probably the worst months.</p>

<p>In October, frequent heavy thunderstorms occur with torrential
rain; they are, however, very local. Heavy dew at night. The storms
get less frequent as the month goes on, and are over before
November, after which the climate gradually improves. The north
wind blows fitfully during November and December, and the nights
are cold, but the temperature by day is very high until late in
December, particularly south of Karkoj. <span class=
"sidenote">Serut fly.</span>The âserut flyâ practically appears and
disappears with the rains, and is scarce in October, except in
certain places. Its northern limit is Sennar. Mosquitoes are bad at
all stations at night during August, September, and October.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cotton.</span>Cotton is cultivated by the
natives on the Blue Nile either on the foreshore of the river or
inland on ground found by experience to be suitable in a good rainy
season.</p>

<p>On the Dinder the only crop raised is the rain crop. This is
sown in July after the heavy rains have commenced at the same time
as dura, etc. The foreshore sowing takes place simultaneously with
that of other foreshore crops, <em>i.e.</em>, about December, after
the river has fallen, according to the state of the Nile and the
height of the submerged banks thus cultivated.</p>

<p>Both rain and foreshore crops begin to be ready for picking 4
months after sowing. There are usually three pickings, the last
being the worst, as by that time the plants, which during winter
are neglected, are invariably suffering from drought.</p>

<p>In a good year one feddan (acre) of rain-watered land will
produce 400 to 1,000 lbs. of unginned cotton. The species of cotton
generally sown on the Blue Nile and Dinder are âAbu Hareira,â
âBelwa,â and âMumtaz.â The two former, usually sown on the
foreshore, are the old native kinds, whilst the latter, sown as
raincrop, was introduced by Mumtaz Pasha from Egypt in the days of
the Old Government. The âAbu Hareiraâ and âBelwaâ kinds last 3
years, but the âMumtazâ only one.</p>

<p>On the Blue Nile, the most favourable land for cotton
cultivation is said to be from Sennar southwards to Abu Naama; on
the Dinder, the land above Deberki and Abu Rakhis is considered
best. Good cotton (irrigated), however, was grown at Wad Medani
last year (1903-1904) on the Government experimental farm; 6Â¾
kantars<a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class=
"fnanchor">[73]</a> being actually grown on 1,000 square metres, or
a Â¼ feddan, giving an average yield of 27 kantars (2,700 lbs.) per
feddan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Principal towns.</span><span class=

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>See under âCountry between
Blue Nile and Rahad,â <a href="#Page_109">p. 109.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tributaries of Blue Nile.</span>With the
exception of the Dinder and the Rahad, there are in the Sudan no
other important affluents of the Blue Nile, with the exception of
perhaps the Khor Tomat, which joins the main stream near Famaka.
This is dry, except during and shortly after the rainy season.
Water, however, is easily obtained by digging in its bed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dinder. General.</span>The River
<span class="sc">Dinder</span> rises in the Abyssinian mountains to
the south-west of Dunkur, and after flowing for about 50 miles
through very mountainous country it enters the plains of the Sudan
and flows for about 200 miles in a north-westerly direction until
it joins the Blue Nile (right bank) about 40 miles above the town
of Wad Medani.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bed.</span>Its bed near Dunkur, where it
leaves the mountains, is rocky and stony, and about 100 yards wide.
It was here found (June, 1901) to be 3 feet deep, with a rapid
current, and for several months in the rainy season it must be
difficult to ford.</p>

<p>Throughout its course in the Sudan its bed, which is sandy and
free from rocks a few miles below where it crosses the frontier, is
much less winding than that of the Rahad and rarely exceeds 200
yards in width. Its tendency is to become narrower in its lower
reaches, and at its mouth it is not more than 120 yards wide.</p>

<p>Upstream of the old site of El Haj the river is wider and
shallower and banks lower than in the inhabited area. Even in the
old days there were few or no permanent villages above El Haj, but
only temporary grazing encampments.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.</span>Its banks are steep and
generally about 15 feet high. They are, as a rule, rather higher
than the adjacent country, which, when the river is full, becomes
flooded and marshy. These marshes were formerly extensively planted
with cotton, which is said to have been of good quality; its
cultivation is now being encouraged as far as the limited
population admits.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Forests.</span>The forests along the
banks of the Dinder are of better quality and less dense than those
of the Rahad; sunt, kakamut, haraz, sidr, hashab, talh, babanus,
etc., are plentiful.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Navigability.</span>The Dinder has been
navigated by steamer as far up-stream as Deberki, about 120 miles
from its mouth. Large sailing boats ascend it as far as El Safra.
Of course, this is only possible whilst the river is in flood
during, perhaps, three months in the year, and owing to the wooded
banks and southerly wind it is very difficult for sailing boats. In
the dry season water stands in pools. There is little doubt,
however, that like the Rahad it is navigable in flood to the
Abyssinian border.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Flood.</span>The flood arrives at the
junction with the Blue Nile about the last week in June. This is
rather earlier than the Rahad flood, owing to the later
commencement of the rains in Northern Abyssinia, and possibly
partly due to the Dinder not being so excessively tortuous as the
Rahad. Both Dinder and Rahad bring down large quantities of
fertilising matter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tributaries.</span>None of much
importance.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rahad. General.</span>The <span class=
"sc">Rahad</span> rises in Abyssinia in the mountainous region
between Lake Tsana on the East and Kwara to the west. It takes, at
first, a northerly direction, but after entering the Sudan it flows
generally north-west in an extraordinarily winding bed to its
junction with the Blue Nile, almost opposite the town of Wad
Medani.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Width.</span>Its width probably nowhere
exceeds 100 yards, and is frequently not more than 60; in places it
is only 30 yards wide. It loses much of its water by âspillsâ known
as âMaya,â and is a much more imposing-looking river above than
below Hawata.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.</span>The banks, especially the
right, are steep and high, sometimes as much as 40 feet above the
bed at low water. They differ from those of the Dinder in that only
the left bank is liable to be flooded, and that only at a few
places, and consequently do not lend themselves to cultivation to
the same extent.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Forest.</span>Belts of dense kittr bush
and other jungle grow along its banks. In the lower reaches there
are many fine sunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
trees, and further inland talh, heglig, etc. Bordering its upper
reaches are heglig, silag, khashkhash, ardeib, tebeldis, gemmeiz,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villages.</span>There are few villages at
present above Hawata (right bank), and consequently there is no
regular path, though the bush has been to a certain extent cleared.
Travelling along the river above Shammam, though practicable, is a
difficult operation, more especially before the grass is burnt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Flood.</span>The flood reaches the Blue
Nile about the first week in July, and water ceases to flow at the
mouth by the end of November. High water is said to last 90 days
from about mid-July.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Navigability.</span>The river, when in
flood, is navigable for small steamers throughout, but its
comparatively narrow bed, combined with very sharp and frequent
bends, militate against successful navigation by sailing boats.</p>

<p>Mr. Armbruster navigated the river in the stern-wheeler Amara
from its mouth to Meshra Abid (420 miles) in August, 1904. On the
way down stream navigation was only effected with considerable
difficulty and serious damage to the steamer, owing to the rate of
the currentâ6 miles per hour at Abid and 3 miles per hour at Sherif
Yagubâas well as to the extreme sharpness of the bends, at which
there were often rocks and large overhanging trees.</p>

"sc">Section 1.âGezira; Khartoum to SennarâGoz Abu Guma
Line</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General description
(topographical).</span>The area of about 7,500 square miles
enclosed by the Blue and White Niles, from their junction at
Khartoum to as far south as the line Sennar-Goz Abu Guma, forms the
northern portion of that generally known as the âGeziraâ or âEl
Hoi,â and contains some of the most fertile and most thickly
populated districts in the Sudan. Though rather sandy in the
neighbourhood of Khartoum, the soil of this flat alluvial plain
gradually becomes richer and richer as one proceeds southwards,
until between Mesellemia and Managil or Abud the acme of fertility
is attained. The eastern half of this district is much more fertile
and cultivated than the western half, a fact perhaps attributable
to the fertilizing properties of the Blue compared to the White
Nile. The whole of this region is so flat and free from khors, or
other indications as to the direction of the drainage, that, except
perhaps just south of Managil, it is impossible, without careful
levelling, to define the watershed between the two rivers.</p>

<p>Bush of any extent and the granite hills, so common in most
parts of the Sudan, are only found along its more southern,
eastern, and western limits, whilst where not cultivated, the
surface of the ground is usually covered with maheirib, homra,
hantut, or naal grass. The entire area is definitely owned by
tribes, families, or individuals, and strangers desiring to
cultivate any portion can only do so on payment of rent, which is
usually taken in kind.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>Many of the tribes,
and their name is legion<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, inhabiting the interior
of this district are of a semi-nomadic nature, that is to say, they
cultivate and graze in the interior during the rains, and in the
dry weather repair to the rivers, where not only is the watering of
their flocks an easier matter and the grazing better than inland,
but much ground is left by the receding Niles available for
cultivation.</p>

<p>On both the Blue and White Niles, however, there is, in
addition, a large and heterogeneous sedentary population.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation (dura).</span>The principal
cereal cultivated is, of course, dura, and a species known as
âfeteritaâ is sown as soon as sufficient rain has fallen, after
which it merely requires to be kept weeded, and in two monthsâ time
is ready for harvesting. The only drawback is that this crop is
entirely dependent on the rainfall, which is often insufficient,
and small banks, 1 to 2 feet high, called âtaras,â are generally
necessary to hold up the water in order to thoroughly flood any
particular piece of land which it is desired to cultivate.</p>

<p>Three ardebs<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a> per feddan (acre approximately) is an
exceptionally good crop, but one ardeb per feddan is the ordinary
yield of rain-watered land. The natives reckon a yield of 15 ardebs
per ruba<a id="FNanchor_75b"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class=
"fnanchor">[75]</a> of seed sown a very good crop for very good
land in a favourable year, but 4 ardebs per ruba is about the
average.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dura shami.</span>Shaduf or sagia-watered
land on the Blue Nile yields 5 ardebs of dura shami (Indian corn)
per feddan, whilst on the White Nile 3Â½ to 4 is an average crop.
Irrigation on the former is usually by sagia, and on the latter by
shaduf.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wheat.</span>Wheat is cultivated to a
limited extent on shaduf or sagia lands, but it is too expensive to
be popular with the natives. An average crop is 5 ardebs per
feddan. It is sown late in November, and harvested three months
later.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cotton.</span>Much has yet to be learnt
as to the suitability of the Gezira for growing cotton. Cotton sown
on the foreshore of the White Nile near Khartoum in July is
irrigated by the flood, and three pickings can be made before the
river becomes too low in February. Experiments so far show âMit
Afifiâ to be the species best adapted to the country, but the
paucity of the rainfall has so far precluded the possibility of
obtaining reliable results from the experiments made. Sufficient
cotton, of a quality suitable for local requirements, has, however,
been grown for many years.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>The water supply
during the dry season of other than the riverain population is from
wells. In the rains these are supplemented by hafirs or tanks. The
depth of the wells varies from 60 feet on the east of the watershed
near the Blue Nile to 100 feet in the centre, where they gradually
become deeper the further south one travels, until a few miles
south of Managil they are as much as 200 feet deep, whilst in the
pans or hollows of the west of the watershed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_118">[118]</span> they are often not more than 15 feet.
These latter wells are peculiar, in that if used for long they
become salt and thus new wells have to be constantly dug.</p>

<p>Many of the wells also in the north of the Gezira are salt.
Nearly all villages have their own well, though occasionally water
is carried for a distance of several miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grazing.</span>There is often very little
grazing a few months after the rains have terminated; during the
dry season, therefore, the flocks are pastured along the banks of
the Niles, and in bad seasons they even cross the river into
Kordofan.</p>

<p>During the Kharif, as the serut fly is not present north of
Sennar-Shawal, many camels and flocks are brought from the south to
graze north of this line.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Chief towns.</span><span class="sc">El
Geteina</span>.â54Â½ miles by road south of Khartoum on right bank
White Nile. Headquarters of Geteina District and residence of
Mamur, police officer, etc. The inhabitants are chiefly Danagla and
Jaalin. The Omdaâs name is Sheikh Mohammed Osman Abd El Rahman, a
Dongolaui. Most of the houses are built of mud. Post and Telegraph
office. (<em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_53">p. 53.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kawa</span>.â132 miles by road south of
Khartoum on White Nile (right bank). It is the same as El Eis of
the old travellers. It has rather a large population of Danagla,
Jaalin, Shaigia, and various blacks. The Omdaâs name is Ismail
Musa. The houses are both mud and flat-roofed, and grass âtukls.â
It is the headquarters of Kawa District and residence of Mamur.
Post and Telegraph office. (<em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_57">p.
57.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Goz Abu Guma</span> (or <span class=
"sc">Zeinoba</span>).âQuite a newly built town of grass tukls on
the White Nile, about 180 miles by road south of Khartoum. A
steamer from Khartoum runs up as far as this with mails weekly.
There is a post office and telegraph office. Residence of a Mamur
and police officer. Inhabitants, Danagla, Jaalin, Gowama, and
blacks. Omda Ahmed Mohammed El Zein, a Jaali. Practically no
transport animals obtainable here. A good deal of gum is collected
here from the interior of Kordofan. (<em>Vide</em> <a href=
"#Page_59">p. 59.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Maatuk</span>.âA collection of tukl villages,
22 miles north-east of Dueim and 29 miles west of Managil. The
population, a large one, consists chiefly of Arakin, also Hassania
and Tawal. The Omdaâs name is Ibrahim Wad El Netef, an Araki.</p>

<p>The water supply is plentiful and good from many wells 15 to 30
feet deep. In the rains the inhabitants, to a great extent, leave
the wells and live on their cultivation, drinking from hafirs or
rain-water tanks. There is much rain cultivation about here in good
years. Where not cultivated, the land is usually covered with
scattered laot and kittr bush. Maatuk belongs to Kawa District of
the Gezira Province.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Managil</span>.âA collection of some half-dozen
or more tukl villages in the centre of the most fertile part of the
Gezira. It is 38 miles from Wad Medani, 50 from Dueim and 107 from
Khartoum. Residence of Mamur and police officer of Managil District
belonging to Gezira Province. Fair âSukâ: market days, Sundays and
Wednesdays. The wells, three in number, are about 150 feet deep.
There is a large mixed population here and throughout the District,
which contains 43,000 inhabitants. The land just south of Managil
is the most suitable in the Gezira for the cultivation of cotton.
This district was handed over to his fellow Taaisha by the Khalifa
Abdalla, and some of the Tagale blacks imported by them to
cultivate have settled in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Segadi</span>.âA large tukl village situated at
the foot of the southern slopes of two low granite hills 50 miles
south of Managil. It belongs to the Sennar Province. The Omdaâs
name is Torin Ahmed, of the Rufaa tribe. The population, numbering
about 1,500 (?), is composed of many different tribes. Water supply
is fairly good. It is about 40 miles from Goz Abu Guma and 36 from
Shawal, on the White Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moya</span>.âAnother large village belonging to
and 21 miles west from Sennar and about 14 miles south-east of
Segadi. There are several hills in the neighbourhood, chief of
which is J. Moya, about 500 feet high, from the summit of which
Jebel Dali, on the road to Gule, is visible bearing 177Â° mag. There
is a road from here to Gule and another to Wad Medani. Water supply
is very bad, and, in fact, almost nil towards the end of the dry
season, when the inhabitants disperse in different directions. The
Omdaâs name is El Imam Hadibai, and the population, which, however,
varies, numbers about 1,200, chiefly Amarna, also Hameg and
Gowama.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kamlin</span>.â58Â½ miles by road and 64Â½ miles
by river from Khartoum, on left bank of Blue Nile. Present (1904)
Headquarters<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class=
"fnanchor">[76]</a> of Gezira Province and residence of Mudir.
There is a large population, consisting of Danagla (several
sections, but chiefly El Jeberked), Mawalads (Mogharba and
Egyptian), Jaalin, and Shaigia. Houses mostly built of mud. Post
and Telegraph office. The Omdaâs name is Abbas Musa.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hellet Amara</span> (or <span class=
"sc">Arbagi</span>).âOn left bank, Blue Nile, 84Â½ miles by road and
95 by river from Khartoum. Opposite Rufaa. There are several
villages in the angle of the river which, however, are so close to
one another that they may be considered as one. Houses mostly built
of mud. Population chiefly Jaalin, Danagla and Batahin, under Omda
El Sheikh Ali El Haj Taha, a Jaali. Amara is the headquarters of
the Mesellemia District of Gezira Province and residence of a
British inspector, Mamur, police officer, etc. Population of
District 32,300, chiefly Halawin, who are the best cultivators in
the Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span><span class=
"sc">Arbagi</span>.âArbagi, which is close to Amara, is one of the
oldest sites in the Sudan, and is mentioned by the learned
Ludolphus in his history of Abyssinia. It was destroyed by the
Shukria early in the 19th or at the end of 18th century.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mesellemia</span>.âMesellemia, from which an
administrative district takes its name, is about 11 miles nearly
due south of Arbagi, and about 6 miles inland from the Blue Nile
(L.B.). Prior to the Mahdia it was a very large town and a great
centre of trade. People are now returning and are rebuilding it.
Surrounding it is some of the most fertile land in the Sudan.
Residence of a Mamur and headquarters of the district.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Wad Medani</span>.âPopulation about 14,000; on
left bank Blue Nile, just above its junction with Rahad; about 1
mile long by Â½ mile broad; large market daily, also bi-weekly,
Monday and Thursday, the largest in the Sudan next to Omdurman.
Founded by El Fiki Medani about 1800 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
Post and telegraph office. Inhabitants: Gezira sedentary tribes,
principally Khawalda, Arakin, Kawahla, Jaalin, Bussalia, and
Medaniim. Headquarters of Gezira Province (1905). Garrison, one
battalion. Rainfall here for 12 monthsâMarch 1903 to February
1904âwas 313Â·5 m.m. or about 12Â½ inches.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Senga</span>.âHeadquarters of Senga District:
will probably be headquarters of Sennar Province in 1905. A large
and increasing village, and next in importance to Wad Medani; left
bank Blue Nile about half mile long and some distance inland; all
built of straw huts except the Government buildings, which are of
brick. Soil fertile, and district much wooded. Population about
1,600. Yearly increasing trade and daily market. Founded by Abdalla
Wad El Hassan about 19 years ago. Inhabitants mostly Jaalin and
Kenana. Post and telegraph offices.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sennar</span>.âAlmost in ruins owing to Dervish
occupation. Has lost all its former importance. Extends about Â¾
mile along the river, surrounded by an old trench and embankments.
There is a large mosque of red burnt bricks, in a very bad state of
repair. At the time of its re-occupation in 1898, Sennar town was
in ruins and uninhabited; it was made headquarters of the province
till, in April, 1900, it was superseded by Wad Medani, Sennar
remaining headquarters of a District. In March, 1903, the
headquarters of the District were removed about 3 miles south of
Sennar to Kabush on the river bank, where new buildings have been
erected; people are now moving and settling between old Sennar and
Kabush. Bi-weekly market Monday and Thursday. In surrounding
district soil very fertile, all land cultivated by rains, except in
Sennar town, which is irrigated by five sagias. Near Kabush there
is thick forest along the river, known as the forest of Kabush,
extending nearly up to Ereidiba. Population 350. Inhabitants:
Kenana, Gawazma, Rufaa, Jaalin, Kawahla, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Wad El Abbas</span>.âPopulation about 1,200;
right bank Blue Nile; founded about 50 years ago. Inhabitants,
Jaalin and Gezira tribes, with some 300 blacks. Weekly market on
Wednesdays.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Section 2.âCountry South of Sennar-Goz Abu
Guma Line to the Sobat</span>.</h3>

<h4 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c05s2a"></a> (a) <em>General
Description.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Topography.</span>The country between the
Niles south of north lat. 13Â° 30â² (approximately) forms the
southern portion of that known as âthe Geziraâ or âEl Hoi,â and is,
save for the riverain population of the Blue Nile and the few
villages on the White Nile between Goz Abu Guma and Jebelein,
practically uninhabited as far south as north parallel 12Â°, which
is the northern limit of Dar Fung.</p>

<p>With the exception of the water in natural tanks at Jebels
Mazmum<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> and Gerebin (which are however apt to run dry)
this level plain is waterless in the driest season, though the soil
is of the richest description, and beyond here and there a few
isolated granite hills, the highest of which is Abu Gurud, its
surface is devoid of all inequalities and undulations. Not a single
khor or wadi is discernible, and except for fairly wide belts of
kittr bush, especially near the two rivers and round the bases of
the hills, the country is on the whole fairly open until nearing
<span class="sidenote">Dar Fung.</span>Dar Fung, when dense forest
commences and stretches, apparently continuously, east and west
from Nile to Nile.</p>

<p>Owing to the scanty water supply during the dry season and the
spongy nature of the soil, it is almost impossible for caravans to
travel otherwise than on the few existing tracks.</p>

<p>South of Gule this forest of talh, hashab, soffar, etc., extends
uninterruptedly to the hills of Tabi on the south-east, and to
Surkum and Keili to the south. About 30 miles south of Gule khors
draining the Tabi hills become frequent, and the surface of the
ground becomes stony, making the going along the already narrow and
much overgrown paths exceedingly bad.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fazogli and Keili.</span>The districts of
Fazogli, Keili, and the greater part of Dul and Kirin are
undulating and much cut up by watercourses, and boast far more
hills than the country further west towards the White Nile. The
hills in these districts<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_120">[120]</span> are scattered promiscuously, and rise
steeply from the surrounding country. They are generally covered
with detached boulders and stunted trees. The plain itself is for
the most part gravelly or stony, and is intersected with dry rocky
khors. It is covered near the foot of the hills with a thick low
growing forest, but away from the hills the bush is generally
thinner. Before it has dried up, the grass among the bush would
make it very difficult to leave the paths, but in the dry season
there is generally no difficulty in getting through the bush,
excepting at the khors. The whole of this country suffers greatly
from want of water, and even where there is water in the streams
near their sources, it soon disappears into the ground. Water can,
however, often be found in many of the stream beds by digging.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">South and south-west of Gule.</span>South
and south-west of Gule stretches an almost uninterrupted plain to
the Baro and Sobat, bounded on the west by the White Nile and on
the east by the hills on the Abyssinian frontier. In the central
and eastern portions of this district there are a few scattered
hills, such as Abuldugu, Melkan, Ulu, etc., belonging to the Burun,
at each of which there is water, but in the Dinka country from
Jebelein southwards along the Nile, these are conspicuous by their
absence. Between north parallels 12Â° 30â² and 10Â° 30â² forest is
almost continuous, however, south of 10Â° 30â² the country becomes
gradually more open and grassy and continues so, as far as is
known, up to the fringe of forest bordering the Baro and Sobat.
Water, south of 10Â° 30â², seems comparatively plentiful, both in
hafirs made by the Burun or standing in pools in khors.</p>

<p>The width of marsh bordering the Baro and Sobat is often much
exaggerated; it seems generally not to exceed 4 to 5 miles in width
along the former, and is more often much less along the latter.
Fringing the marsh is a narrow belt of forest, and behind that
steppe-like country, which becomes practically treeless in the
region of the lower Sobat (<em>vide</em> <a href="#p1c06">Chap.
VI</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage.</span>Khor Tomat, draining Beni
Shangul and Fazogli is the principal khor emptying into the Blue
Nile.</p>

<p>The more important ones emptying into the White Nile are:â</p>

<p>Khor Deleib, source in Jebel Tabi and mouth at Renk; Khors Rau
and Balantega, mouths at Jebel Ahmed Agha, but source conjectural,
and Khor Adar or Yal, which empties into the White Nile about 30
miles north of Fashoda, and possibly forms the mouth of both the
Yabus and Sonka. Another theory is that the Sonka and Yabus drain
into a marsh, from which a certain amount of water is believed to
find its way into the Sobat near Nasser. Khor Garre drains into the
Baro.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rainfall.</span>The rainfall over the
whole of this area is heavy, especially in the more southern
districts, where the rainy season may be said to extend from the
end of April till the beginning of November.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport animals.</span>Camels, mules,
or donkeys do well throughout the whole of this district, except
during the rains, when mules are probably the best. At this season
the serut fly is present everywhere, and in the dry season along
the Nile there is a small black fly, similar in general appearance
to the common house-fly, which is excessively annoying and somewhat
injurious to camels. Abyssinian horses are useful, and the ordinary
Arab does well, though more delicate.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>The only roads<a id=
"FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
known to exist, with the exception of those from Senga to Moya, and
Senga to Jebelein, <em>viÃ¢</em> Teigo and Jebel Dali, are described
in the route reports in Vol. 2, <a href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74585/74585-h/74585-h.htm#c05">Chap.
V.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Currency.</span>In the more northern
parts of this region the ordinary Sudan currency is <em>de
rigueur</em>, but in dealings with natives along the Abyssinian
frontier Maria Theresa dollars or gold rings, obtainable at Abu
Shaneina (36 Maria Theresa dollars = 1 oz. gold, approximately),
are generally required, though in Fazogli, Keili, or in fact in any
Arabic-speaking district, Egyptian money is as a rule readily
accepted.<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a> Menelekâs dollar is only very rarely seen, and
his smaller coins never. The Maria Theresa dollar is not, as a
rule, accepted unless the brooch on the shoulder is pretty clearly
distinguishable. Amongst the Gallas salt bars form the small change
(3Â½ bars = 1 Maria Theresa dollar).</p>

<p>In the Dinka country on the White Nile, giraffe or buffalo hides
are the best trade goods; âgianottaâ<a id=
"FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and other large beads, as well as Egyptian money are also
acceptable. Along the Sobat, beads (large amber, opaque white,
small white, âgianotta,â<a id="FNanchor_80b"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> etc.), spear heads, axes,
and fasses are all much in request. Money is becoming daily more
readily taken.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mosquitos.</span>Mosquitos, or âBa-udaâ
as they are called by the Dinkas and by many Sudanese Arabs, are
very numerous in places even in the dry season along the White
Nile, though here and there there are none even quite close to the
water. The natives themselves, though not professing belief in the
Anopheles theory, say that if one is bitten much by them they cause
fever. The fact of there being a village at any spot may be
accepted as sufficient guarantee that there are no, or at any rate,
very few, mosquitos there. Most of the villages even in the dry
season are a mile or more from the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>The following species are
represented:âElephant, buffalo, giraffe, hippopotamus, hartebeeste
(<i>Jacksonii</i> and <i>tora</i>), tiang, roan-antelope, kudu,
waterbuck, reedbuck, bushbuck, cobus leucotis, gazelle, oribi,
lion, leopard, cheetah, etc. Specimens of Neumannâs hartebeeste are
also believed to have been shot near Ahmed Agha.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span><a id=
"p1c05s2b"></a>(b) <em>Dar Fung</em> (<em>South of North Lat.</em>
12Â°).</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boundaries.</span>Dar Fung is now,
compared to its palmy days, an unimportant district. Its boundaries
are: on the north, Jebels Gereiwa and Rera; on the east, Jebel
Agadi and the Fazogli district. Southwards, it extends to the
Abyssinian frontier, and, including the district of Keili and the
northern Burun country, extends westwards towards the Dinkas of the
White Nile.</p>

<p>In the days when the Fung were at their best, it included Dul
and Assosa etc., which now belong to Abyssinia.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">J. Tabi and Ingassana.</span>Jebel Tabi
and district is included in Dar Fung. The Ingassana, now under Mek
Agoda, who inhabit it, remained independent and refused to pay
tribute to Idris Wad Regab or the Government until February, 1903,
when the Mudir visited this district and established the
headquarters of the Dar Fung District at Soda instead of Gule,
without opposition. The Ingassana are seldom met without their
peculiar sickle-shaped swords. They also possess curious
boomerang-like throwing-sticks. They keep apparently a good deal to
themselves, as complaints against them are rare. They expressed
delight at coming under the Ã¦gis of the Government, and at the
assurance of their future immunity from slave raids. The district
of Tabi is hilly and well watered, and appears to be much more
healthy than the surrounding plains. It is said to much resemble
Erkowit in the Suakin district. Pigs are not uncommon in this
district, and the menu of the chiefs is a varied one, dogs, horses,
camels, leopards, etc., are all eaten, especially the former, with
great relish. The skulls of all animals consumed are arranged in
order round the enclosures of the houses.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Idris Wad Regab.</span>Idris Wad Regab, a
direct descendant of the old Fung dynasty, is now Mek or head
Sheikh of Dar Fung. He is a loyal man, and is now very badly off,
having suffered greatly at the hands of the Dervishes, by whom he
was not recognised. Sheikh Abd El Kader is his Wakil. Adlan Wad
Surur was Mek during the Mahdia; he now lives near Karkoj.</p>

<p>Gule used to be the chief town of Dar Fung, it is now only
second in importance to Keili. It consists of three small villages
situated at the foot of Jebel Idris or Gule, a granite mass about
1,000 feet high, and contains but a few hundred inhabitants, mostly
Hameg, or a mixture of Hameg and the aboriginal Fung. There are
generally some encampments of Dar Ageil or Selim Arabs in the
vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>There is a little trade with
Abyssinia, but practically nothing in the shape of supplies,
animals etc., are procurable here. Most of the merchants trading
with Abyssinia pass through Keili.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>There is the usual
dura and simsim cultivation, but little more is grown than is
required for the wants of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Raids.</span>As, prior to the demarcation
of the Abyssinian frontier, the Burun were so decimated by raiding
parties from Abyssinian territory, Idris Wad Regab was, in March,
1902, given rifles by the Government to protect his people. In
addition to these he had a good many of his own, with which he
inflicted some loss on Ahmed Fedilâs force when it marched from
Dakhila to the White Nile after the battle of Roseires, December,
1898. These raids have ceased for the present owing to the capture
of the principal raider, Ibrahim Wad Mahmud, in February, 1904.

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>Water, which is
obtained from several holes at the foot of the Jebel, is fairly
plentiful but bad. It is said to be impregnated with lime.</p>

<h5><em>Burun.</em>
</h5>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boundaries, etc.</span>The Burun inhabit
the country between the Dinkas of the White Nile and the Abyssinian
frontier from about 11Â° 30â² north latitude southwards to the Dinkas
and Nuers of the Sobat and Baro. Those among the hills north of K.
Yabus are under Mek Idris Wad Regab, of Gule, and appear to have
acknowledged the suzerainty of his predecessors for probably a
century before the advent of the Turks. On the K. Yabus and south
of it nothing can be definitely stated as to their organisation,
but they appear to be divided into a number of independent
communities.</p>

<p>The Burun are said to be related to the Berta, but they are
lighter in colour than the Berta generally are and speak a
different language.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Burun near K. Yabus.</span>Major Gwynn
gives the following description of the Burun near Khor Yabus: The
men, who are physically very finely built, are stark naked, and
smear their heads with wet and clammy red mud.<a id=
"FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
They all carry long bows, wooden pointed featherless arrows, and in
addition, generally a spear. Arrows are poisoned by being stuck
into a certain species of tree,<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and are pointed with
notched charred wood or ebony. They have a range of 150
yards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> The women
are also naked, save for a small loin cloth of skin. They are good
looking and attractive. The Burun dialect spoken by Idris Wad
Regabâs men, but no Arabic, is understood by the Burun of the
Yabus. Their word of greeting is âMoka.â</p>

<p>The Burun north of K. Yabus live as a rule on the scattered
hills during the rains, and drink from the rainwater which collects
in natural rock tanks. During the dry season, when this water is
exhausted, they either descend to the plain and live on the khors,
in many of which water stands in pools, or else have to carry their
water for a considerable distance. Some of the hills inhabited by
them are Abuldugu, Surkum, Melkan, Gum Gum, and Wadaga. K.
Gemmeiza, flowing from near J. Abuldugu towards Melut, furnishes
their principal water supply. They also obtain water from âHafirs,â
or ponds, which are roofed with thatch to lessen evaporation. Wells
seem to be very rarely sunk. These northern Burun are now very
poor, and women and children are very scarce.</p>

<p>The Burun, in the Garre Valley, seem more prosperous, having
plenty of water and grain in their country, but both sections,
especially the northern, have been most deplorably reduced by slave
raids from the east. The principal raider, however, Ibrahim Wad
Mahmud, as before stated, was captured by Lieutenant-Colonel
Gorringe in February, 1904. The southern Burun country is still
almost entirely unexplored.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Communications.</span>The Burun seem to
have little intercourse with the tribes living on the White Nile,
and no regular roads to it, except perhaps from J. Gerawid to J.
Ahmed Agha, seem to exist. It is intended, however, to open up
roads between the western frontier of Abyssinia and the Nile, and
to improve the present primitive system of water supply in this
district. For report on routes, <em>vide</em> <a href=

<h5><em>Keili.</em>
</h5>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boundaries.</span>Keili, which is part of
Dar Fung, is bounded on the east and south-east by the Abyssinian
frontier, which divides it from Beni Shangul, Gomasha, and Dul, and
on the north-east by Fazogli. Keili claims to share with Fazogli
the mountains of Agaru, Kashangaru, and Ragreig, though practically
the whole of Agaru belongs to the latter, and the whole of Ragreig
to the former, as also does Jebel Gainshur. Jebels Kurmuk and Maiak
are within the southern limits of this district, and Jebels Surkum
and Abuldugu to the west also belong to it. On the north the
boundary is Jebel Tabi.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The Jebelawin inhabit
the eastern portions of the district, and the Burun the western.
For administrative purposes, this district is in the Dar Fung
District.</p>

<p>The acting Mek of Keili is a youth of about 15 years of age. His
father, Beshir Hamdan, who was much addicted to slave dealing, was
arrested and deposed by Government, February, 1903.</p>

<p>The valley between Ragreig and Jebel Keili forms as it were an
oasis, and must have a population of several thousand. It is a very
pleasant spot in the dry season, but in the rains becomes more or
less swampy.</p>

<p>Sheikh Bilburka, of the Fung inhabitants of Dul, now lives at
Keili in order to avoid the exactions of the Watawit, under
Abyssinian rule, similarly Sheikh Jela Abdalla, a Jaali refugee,
fled from Beshir and Shanji villages in 1897, and now lives in the
Arab settlement at Keili.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Language.</span>The Jebelawin language is
used at Jebel Keili. The Burun use a dialect of the Burun language
similar to that of Jebel Maiak.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation, etc.</span>In the valley
between Jebels Kurmuk and Keili a great deal of dura is grown, both
for local consumption and for the supply of the mountaineers in the
hills near Dul. There are plenty of cattle, sheep and pigs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gold.</span>Some alluvial gold is found
in the khor east of Jebel Ragreig.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>Water is obtained
from wells and from pools in khors, whilst on the face of Jebel
Keili itself there are several springs. At Jebel Surkum there is a
perennial supply of muddy water from four holes on the south side
of the Jebel.</p>

<p>At Jebel Abuldugu there is water in the pass through which the
road from Gule leads. This, however, does not last all the year
round. Natives then water in the Khor Ganna, about 2 miles to the
east.</p>

<p>Keili is the chief town of Dar Fung and is rapidly growing. It
is situated at the foot and to the south of J. Keili, and is the
residence of the Mek. There is also a small garrison of Sudanese
regulars here from Wad Medani, as well as some mounted
irregulars.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c05s2c"></a>(c) <em>Fazogli.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boundaries.</span>Fazogli is not included
in Dar Fung, but belongs to the Roseires District; it is bounded
for administrative purposes as follows:âOn the north-west and west
by the Hameg (Abu Gemai to Jebel El Geri), on the north by the
Jebel Geri-Abu Ramla line, and from Abu Ramla its boundary runs
southwards along the Abyssinian frontier to Jebel Kashangaru,
thence northwards towards Jebel Agadi, Dar Fung being to the west
of this line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Mek.</span>The Mekâs name is Regab Hassan, who is
surnamed Abadaro, and is a middle-aged man who appears to have a
good deal of influence, but is said to be addicted to drink. He
claims descent from Jaber, the first Fung conqueror of Fazogli.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants. Jebelawin.</span>The
principal inhabitants are Jebelawin, an aboriginal race merged into
the ruling Fung living at Fazogli, Kuturu, Kiri, Abu Shaneina on
both banks, and Adarsi. Their villages on the Tumat and at Abu
Shaneina are under Mek Khamis, a Jebelawi, but the Arabs at the
latter place are under an Arab named Ali Wad Rowaa.</p>

<p>Elias Khamis, the former Fung ruler of the Jebelawin of Beni
Shangul lives on the Tomat with a following of Sudanese refugees
from Beni Shangul. Sheikh Fakir is similarly in charge of Arab
refugees from the south.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Language.</span>Arabic is understood by
the Sheikhs of the district, but the rotana in use on the left bank
of the Nile is that used by the Hameg of the Blue Nile, and by the
Jebelawin and Berta. On the right bank, in the Fazogli district,
the Gumz language is totally different.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>The Sheikhs alone profess
Mohammedanism; the majority of the Jebelawin are heathen.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Berta.</span>In the hills the inhabitants
are nearly all Berta; very few can talk Arabic. They are as a rule
finely developed and healthy looking, but are dull and lazy to a
degree. Their villages are built in the most inaccessible places;
the tukls being wedged amongst great boulders. They only grow small
patches of dura, and depend entirely on the rains to irrigate it.
During the dry season, even for drinking, water has to be carried
immense distances. A great many fowls are kept in the villages. The
men in some places wash for gold in the khors.</p>

<p>The Berta of Jebel Falabut are under Mek Abadalla, those of
Jebel Faronge are under Mek Amaka. On the latter mountain are
separate villages for the Faronge sub-tribe, part of the Fadoko
sub-tribe, and the Goamili, who were driven from Jebel Abdanab of
late years by the rulers of Beni Shangul. The head-quarters of the
Fadoko sub-tribe remain at Sarankchau, near Abdanab on the Yabus
river, subject to the Sultan of Beni Shangul. Falabut and Faronge
are in charge of Mek Abu Ras of Kiri.</p>

<p>The Berta extend westwards from the Blue Nile through Gezan to
Mudeli village (Sheikh El Nur) to Jebel Sude sub-district (Sheikh
Hambalha), and Khor Gasa (Mek Jibara), south and west of which the
Berta have lost their independence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>The Berta, though
heathen, are not averse to Mohammedanism.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gezan.</span>Bakurig Bugul, the successor
of Gormaz, the last aboriginal Mek of Gezan sub-district, lives at
Fazogli. Hassan Wad El Gharbi is the Sheikh of the Watawit at Gezan
and Amora, Mek Abulang being resident chief of the Berta.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gumz.</span>The word âGumzâ signifies
âpeopleâ in the aboriginal language, of which the various
sub-tribes use distinct dialects. The Gumz, of which the Bazaroda
and Kadalo are sub-tribes, are heathen, God and sun being
synonymous.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bazaroda.</span>The Bazaroda sub-tribe is
under Mek Ya Karda, grandson of Ab Zaroda. The boundaries are the
Blue Nile on the south and Khor Bombode on the east. Headquarters,
Hoburra. Other villages are Kambal, Yagor, Agabar, and Yarada.
Though subject to Abadaro, the Mek of Gubba demanded as tribute, in
1900 and 1901, 50 ardebs of dura and 30<em>l.</em> worth of gold
dust. Products include cotton, dura, simsim, âzafâ or dom fibre,
and Adansonia bark rope, honey, gungeleis or Adansonia fruit, and
gold dust from the Nile, near the mouth of the Khor Zuar.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kadalo.</span>El Kadalo sub-tribe,
formerly peopled Jebel Dimr and Jebel Mulki, but Mek Adam, owing to
a blood feud with the Fung ruler of Gubba, is now living on the
Nile with his following from those hills. The rest of the Kadalo
are under him, and subject to Abadaro of Fazogli. In the Samina
Hills there are Kadalo at Beletamaru and Masambaga, under Mek Ahmed
Wad Mohammed, surnamed El Wishari, also at Jabranza under his son
Beshir Ahmed.</p>

<p>At Jebel Metongwe the local Mek is Mansur, and at Jebel Menze,
Mek Idris.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Principal villages.
Fazogli.</span><span class="sc">Fazogli</span> the residence of the
Mek, is a straggling village of tukls, extending about 2 miles
along a ridge of high ground running parallel to the river. This
ridge is about 800 yards from the river, and the low intervening
ground is given over entirely to cultivation. The ground behind
Fazogli rises to the height of 1,750 feet at a distance of 2 miles,
and is covered with trees.</p>

<p>The water supply is from the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Famaka.</span>The old mudiria of
<span class="sc">Famaka</span> is an enclosure about 120 yards
square, surrounded by a stone wall, which is still in good
condition. It is situated on the river bank on a solid rock, which
stands in a bend of the river facing E.S.E., and about 60 feet
above it, and holds a commanding view of the country to the south
for miles.</p>

<p>It is itself, however, commanded at a distance of 800 yards by
the very high ground rising behind Fazogli.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abu Shaneina.</span><span class="sc">Abu
Shaneina</span> is the most important village or town in Fazogli.
It is here that the trade route from Beni Shangul strikes the Blue
Nile, and it is chiefly from that quarter that any considerable
increase of trade with Abyssinia can be expected. It is the
headquarters of a small frontier force furnishing outlying
detachments north and south of the Blue Nile. Mek Khamis is Sheikh
of the Jebelawin here and Ali Wad Rowaa of the Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kiri.</span><span class="sc">Kiri</span>
is the most prosperous (1900) looking village in Fazogli, and is
built on what should be a very healthy site near the river. The
Sheikhâs name is Abu Ras Wad Sogheir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Masurkum.</span><span class="sc">Masurkum</span> is on
the Beni Shangul Abu Shaneina road. The Sheikh, named Bikori, is an
old and infirm man, but has evidently been a strong man in his
time. He suffered considerably from Dervish raids, and has lost all
his cattle.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>Dura, simsim, lubia,
and tobacco are the principal crops cultivated, the former is of
good quality, both Naggad and Kurgi being sown. In Gezan there is a
considerable area under cultivation, but with this exception there
is practically none south of a line drawn from Kiri through Jebel
Kukura to Masurkum and thence up Khor Masurkum.</p>

<p>In the Tomat villages, west of Jebel Fazogli, the dura crop is
very fine, but simsim is chiefly grown between Kiri and
Fazogli.</p>

<p>Ground close to Tomat would undoubtedly repay cultivation, but
at present the more easily cleared areas near the Nile are amply
sufficient for the population.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle, etc.</span>There are
comparatively few cattle and sheep in the district, the people
having suffered so much from raids.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>A good deal of trade is
carried on with Beni Shangul and this is bound to develop.</p>

<p>Fazogli produces a little gold, which is found in all the khors
coming from Jebel Faronge: Khor El Dahab, near Gezan, being the
richest.</p>

<p>A good deal of coffee is imported from Abyssinia, as well as
horses, mules, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.</p>

<p>The idea of ever tapping the trade of the Abyssinian province of
Gojjam is said to be out of the question owing to the apparent
impossibility of finding a trade route free from physical
difficulties of an insuperable kind.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport.</span>Donkeys or mules are the
best transport animals all round, though camels do very well as
long as their feet do not get sore. All the transport animals
available for purchase, or otherwise, are those that come in from
Abyssinia, and the supply is a very fluctuating one.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c05s2d"></a>(d) <em>Dinkas on the White
Nile.</em></h4>

<p>The Dinka country on the White Nile, extends from Jebelein
southwards to about 10 miles south of Kodok, along the right bank;
it is uninhabited, however, except by Nomad Selim, north of
Karshawal.</p>

<p>The Dinkas, or Jange, as they are called by the Arabs, have no
Mek like the Shilluks, but each section is separate and independent
under its own sheikh, consequently, they were never able to unite
to defend themselves against the depredations of slave traders and
the Dervishes, who found them an easy prey. Many of their sheikhs
at the present time are men who have been slaves in Cairo, and who
have been repatriated either by Gordon or the present Sudan
Government. Thus it is that, whilst the majority of the men are
stark naked, one here and there meets a respectably dressed old man
carrying a sunshade.</p>

<p>The women ordinarily wear a goatskin apron in front and another
behind, but the unmarried girls are usually content with a string
of beads.</p>

<p>The men mould their hair, mixed with red mud, into fantastic
shapes, and sleep on a bed of cow-dung ash, with which their bodies
are covered. The women do not usually thus disfigure themselves,
and sleep on hide mats.</p>

<p>The Dinkas are remarkable for their height and slender limbs and
figures. They are not, however, of such fine physique as their
neighbours the Shilluks.</p>

<p>They are unenterprising and ignorant to a degree, and so
unprogressive and rigidly conservative that any such up-to-date
innovation as the introduction of donkeys<a id=
"FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
for transport purposes, an innovation admitted by themselves to be
most desirable, is not adopted simply on the pretext that it was
not the custom of their fathers and forefathers.</p>

<p>They consequently always walk, the men carrying long narrow
bladed spears and a knob-kerry, and the women a large basket on
their heads containing their food, etc.</p>

<p>During the dry season the Dinkas desert the hinterland of the
river, and descend with their flocks and herds to live near its
banks, where the now dry marshes afford excellent grazing.</p>

<p>The localities which they frequent mostly are Renk, El Wat,
Jebel Ahmed Agha, Meshra Zeraf, Kaka (right bank), Khor Adar. There
are police posts at Renk and Melut; Renk being the headquarters of
the District and residence of a British Inspector.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>On the arrival of the
rains they, for the most part, retire inland, sometimes 20 or 30
miles, to their cultivation, which however, is little more than
sufficient for their own requirements. The grain is stored in these
cultivation villages, and is only brought to the river in the dry
season in small quantities from time to time on the womenâs
heads.</p>

<p>Donkeys, and indeed any means of transport but their womenâs
heads are unknown. If, therefore, it is desired<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> to purchase any dura from the
Dinkas in the dry season, the would-be purchaser must be prepared
to provide transport and to send it a day or so inland.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Herds, etc.</span>The Dinkas of the White
Nile, who number about 8,000, own a good many cattle and sheep, and
pay tribute on them to the Government partly in kind and partly in
money (1904). According to a census made in 1903, the following
were the estimated numbers of their herds and flocks: cattle,
8,000; sheep, 16,000; goats, 13,000.</p>

<p>Though living in a grand game country they have no sporting
instincts whatever, and rely on the Baggara Arabs to provide them
with skins in exchange for dura. They fish to a certain extent, but
are not nearly so expert as their neighbours the Shilluks, unlike
whom they have no aquatic proclivities.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>A certain number, owing
to their having travelled to Khartoum and even Cairo as slaves,
profess the Mohammedan faith, but their number is few. The
remainder believe in the existence of a being who rules their
destiny, and whom they call Deng. He has many forms and shapes,
from the spirit of a great departed Sheikh to the more familiar
personality of a favourite cow. They also believe in the
possibility of transferring their spirits to a particular animal
for a particular purpose and for a stated time; for instance, if an
unwelcome individual is present, they annoy him in the guise of
hyÃ¦nas at night until he departs. (<em>Vide</em> also Chap. VI,
<a href="#p1c06s2d">Section 2 (<em>d</em>),</a> and <a href=
"#p1c07">Chap. VII.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Marriage customs.</span>(<em>a</em>)
<em>Arranging Marriage.</em>âThe intending bridegroom must obtain
the consent of the girlâs father or guardian, as the case may be,
and settle the âmaalâ (purchase price). He does not necessarily pay
the whole at the time, but later, if he finds the girl suits him,
and does not have any dealings with other men, he pays the
difference; also sometimes after paying the full âmaalâ he may be
ordered by a village council to pay an additional âmaalâ if he is a
rich man.</p>

<p>As a rule the âmaalâ is paid to the girlâs father or guardians a
year or so before the man marries her; she remaining meanwhile in
her fatherâs house. If during this period of âengagementâ the man
comes to the conclusion that the girl is not suited to him, he can
terminate the engagement, and receives back his cattle. No
inter-marriage of blood relations is allowed under any
circumstances, on the other hand, a man may marry all or any of his
late fatherâs widows (except of course his own mother). In this
connection it is interesting to note that, if a girl is tampered
with and subsequently becomes ill, it is held to be conclusive
proof that she was tampered with by a blood relation, and the blood
relations who could possibly have been responsible for the offence
are ordered to pay a heavy fine to the girlâs father.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Misconduct of a FiancÃ©e.</em>âIf a fiancÃ©e
misconducts herself, the bridegroom elect receives back all the
cattle that he may have paid to the girlâs relations, but, if, on
the other hand, he still chooses to marry her, he will not receive
his cattle back, but will exact a âfine maalâ from the man with
whom the girl misconducted herself. If he does not choose to marry
the girl he receives back his cattle, and the father of the girl
receives the âfine maalâ from the delinquent. If the man still
marries the girl under these circumstances, he slaughters one of
the cattle paid as âfine maalâ and invites the whole village to
dinner; but if he does not marry her, the girlâs father does not
follow this custom of slaying the bull.</p>

<p>The father or guardian who receives the marriage portion of the
girl does not retain the whole to himself, but it is divided
according to certain rules among the relations. A man having
received a marriage portion on behalf of his daughter or ward, and
the girl being still only âengaged,â may not dispose of any of it,
until the girl is actually married, and has entered her husbandâs
house.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Misconduct after Marriage.</em>âIf a man has
dealings with a married woman, her husband shall take a âfine maalâ
from the adulterer, two or three head of cattle according to the
adultererâs wealth. If the wife go wrong, the husband may cast her
off, and send her back to her people, and receive back from them
the âmaalâ he originally paid, plus the issue of the said cattle
since they left his hands. If the husband go wrong, the father or
guardian of the girl he has wronged will take a fine âmaalâ from
him; his wife cannot divorce him.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) <em>Divorce.</em>âIf a man maltreats his wife she
may complain to her father, who may free her by paying the husband
back the original âmaal,â plus its issue. If the father has no
cattle, he will receive his daughter into his house, and when she
marries, recompense the late husband.</p>

<p>If a man wishes to divorce his wife, and has good grounds for
wishing to do so, he will return her to her father or guardian and
receive back his original âmaal,â plus the issue or not, according
to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>If a man divorce his wife for misconduct, and there are children
of the marriage, they will remain with him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Misconduct.</span>(<em>a</em>) If a man
misconduct himself with a girl he will pay to her father or
relations a âmaalâ such as he would have paid had he wished to
marry the girl in the usual way, and he must marry her. If,
however, the father of the girl is not willing to marry his
daughter to the man, he will not exact a full âmaalâ from him, but
only a âfine maalâ according to the manâs wealth. If a girl
misconduct herself, and dies from the effects, the man responsible
will pay her father eight head of cattle.</p>

<p>If a man misconduct himself with an engaged girl, and marries
her in the place of the original fiancÃ©e he shall pay to her father
the same âmaalâ as was paid in the first instance by the other man,
and if the girl die in his house,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> he shall have no claim to receive back all
or any of his âmaalâ from her father or whoever received his
âmaal,â but in most cases the father will pay him a proportion as a
favour.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Misconduct with a Blood Relation.</em>âThe man
who is convicted of misconducting himself with a blood relation
will pay to the girlâs father one bull and one cow-calf. The bull
will be cut into two halves, and afterwards devoured at a village
feast; the couple will not, of course, be allowed to marry.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Blood maal.</span>If a man has an adopted
daughter, who has been paid to him as âblood maal,â she is not
allowed to marry out of her adopted fatherâs family, except in rare
cases in which she happens to be a blood relation of her adopted
family. A man thus possessing an adopted daughter, paid originally
as a âblood maal,â can terminate the blood feud by paying to her
father or relations a small âmaalâ of cattle.</p>

<p><em>Violating a âblood maal girl.â</em>âIf a man has dealings
with a girl who has been paid as a âblood maal,â he shall be
ordered to pay one head of cattle, which, however, can never be
returned. If a man has connection with a girl who does not come
under this category, he pays, as stated before, a certain âmaal,â
which, however, is returned to him when the girl eventually
marries, together with the issue of the âmaal.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Death of a wife.</span>If a wife die
before she has been received into her husbandâs house, he receives
back the âmaalâ he has paid in advance for her. If she die after
being received into her husbandâs house, he does not, as a matter
of course, receive his âmaalâ back, but the father will almost
invariably pay him back half as a favour. If there are children of
the marriage, the widower will not receive any cattle back.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Death of a husband.</span>If a husband
die his widow will remain with her late husbandâs relations unless
her own relations choose to pay back the âmaalâ originally received
for her, in which latter case the custody of the children is
generally given to her late husbandâs people.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Disposal of property.</span>If a man die
and leave property, it goes to his sons, failing a son, if he leave
a married daughter who has a son it goes to him. Failing any issue,
his property goes to his male relations. The widow of a man will
never receive his property.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">History of the Dinkas of the White
Nile</span>.</h5>

<p>This section of the Dinkas migrated from the Bahr-el-Ghazal
about 130 or 150 years ago, as nearly as can be judged from various
sources of information, and most of their customs, their character,
and habits of daily life, are identical with the corresponding
traits of the Bahr-el-Ghazal Dinkas as recorded by Schweinfurth.
Some of the older Dinkas of the âIbrahimâ section, especially those
whose wits have been sharpened by a visit to Cairo or Khartoum,
appear to take a considerable interest in tracing back their
history.</p>

<p>At the time of the migration, the head of the Bahr-el-Ghazal
Dinkas was one Akwai Chakab. He descended into the country on the
right bank of the White Nile north of the Sobat, and drove out the
Arab inhabitants; these were chiefly Fung, Abu Rof, and Jaalin, the
latter being also partly on the left (west) bank. No mention is
made of the presence of any Baggara Arabs on the west bank. Akwai
Chakab was accompanied by one Kur Deng Achuk wad Agweir, and by his
own son, Deng Karuma wad Akwai. Having seized the country and
installed his own people, Akwai Chakab returned to his own country
in the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and left the Government of his new country
in the hands of his son, Deng Karuma and Kur Deng Achuk wad Agweir.
Another son of Akwai Chakab accompanied his father in the seizure
of the new territories; this was Kolong wad Akwai, and to him was
entrusted the command of the advance guard of the army. His orders
were to push on ahead, spy out the country, and eventually attack
Sennar and the El Ahamda, etc., and reinforcements would be
supplied from the rear if necessary.</p>

<p>On the conquest of the Sudan by Mohammed Ali Pasha, the invading
âTurksâ did not penetrate the east bank beyond Jebel Ahmed Agha;
how far south they went on the west bank is not stated. On the east
bank, however, they had to fight the powerful Dinka forces from
Muli (now called Renk) and did not always come off victors (Muli
was at that time called by the Arabs âHasoiaâ). The Dinkas,
however, being forced to fall back, retreated up Khor Rau, east of
Ahmed Agha, followed by the âTurks,â who came up with them, and
fell on them at the Debba Mabiu. The âTurksâ completely routed
them, and seized and carried off their cattle, but none of their
women or children. Mention is made of the âTurksâ fighting with the
Shilluks near Kaka. The invading army then appears to have retired
from the country, leaving the Dinkas to their own devices; and they
do not seem to have been troubled again for a considerable time.
They were, however making mischief, and they admit that the evil
days that befel them at a later date was the inevitable consequence
of their own misdeeds. Strong enough to hold their own against
other neighbouring tribes, they appear to have turned their
attention to annoying the Government, and amongst other exploits,
penetrated to Karkoj, killed Sheikh Abdallahi and some of his
people, and robbed the remainder. The Governor-General of the Sudan
at, or about the time of these occurrences, 1863, was Musa Pasha
Hamdi, and he detailed an army under the command of Mohammed Kheir,
to go into the Dinka country and wipe out the Dinkas. This was the
commencement of their troubles which did not end till 1898. The
first descent upon the Dinkas was in the Abialang district,
otherwise known as the Dinka<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_130">[130]</span> Ibrahim. The inhabitants fled to Jebel Gule
and threw themselves under the protection of Sheikh Regab wad
Idris, and paid him heavy tribute on the understanding that he
would arrange matters between themselves and the Government. Regab
wad Idris appears to have accepted the tribute, and then to have
sent word to Sennar that the fugitive Dinkas were in his power.
Thereupon a force of Egyptian soldiery was despatched from Sennar,
and captured the fugitive Dinkas, whom they led off as slaves. The
men were enrolled in the Nubian regiments, and the women and
children sold. Orders subsequently came to release them, but a
considerable number of the men were, nevertheless, kidnapped, and
many remained in the regiments; of the latter, there are now
several still serving in the army as more or less senior officers.
On those occasions when the Dinka forces defeated the Government
troops, the locality of the battle has generally been called by the
Dinkas by the name of the commander of the Government troops, such
as the Island of Wad Ab Kona, of which the original Dinka name,
also still used, was Gasa-el-Abiad. Other instances are Wad Ab
Sheiba and (Jebel) Ahmed Agha.</p>

<p>The result of these depredations was that the Dinkas were
practically driven to exist as outlaws, living in the woods or in
the inaccessible Nuer country. They never, however, lost their hold
over their own country, and whenever the Government forces
withdrew, they would return to the vicinity of their villages,
ready to fly at a momentâs notice.</p>

<p>In later days, in the time of the Dervish regime, those Dinka
districts which, on demand, paid up the whole of their cattle, were
not further molested; on the other hand, the people south of Jebel
Ahmed Agha declined to fall in with this proposal, and were
consequently perpetually harried and raided, and had many of their
women and children carried off, the Dinkaâs first care being always
to drive his cattle off to a place of safety. Since the
establishment of a settled Government, the Dinkas have been
returning in increasing numbers to their country, but the general
complaint now is, that at the present time, hundreds, and even
thousands of Dinkas are still in the service of those who seized
them, or bought them in the old days, and who would, if they had an
opportunity, return to their country.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c05s2e"></a>(e) <em>Selim Baggara.</em></h4>

<p>The Selim Baggara, though really belonging to the left bank from
opposite to Jebelein southwards nearly to Kaka, cross over to the
right bank in considerable numbers during the dry season. They
prefer to live amongst the Dinkas, as they rely on them principally
for their grain supply, not being cultivators to any extent
themselves. A good many of them are mounted on Abyssinian ponies
(price 30 to 40 sheep, <em>i.e.</em>, 3<em>l.</em> to 4<em>l.</em>)
on which they hunt elephant, buffalo, and giraffe in the most
fearless manner, armed only with their long broad-headed Baggara
spears. The skins of these animals are readily accepted by the
Dinkas in exchange for dura. The Selim are divided into two
sections, Um Tarif and Walad Mahbub; the Sheikh of the former is
Amin Musa,<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class=
"fnanchor">[84]</a> and of the latter El Hag Suleiman, both live on
the left bank opposite Jebelein. The tribe owns a considerable
number of sheep, but little or no cattle. They cultivate to a small
extent on the borders of the Gimma country, about 20 miles
north-west from Jebelein.</p>

<p>The Arab names for places are, as a rule, quite unknown to the
Dinkas, and <em>vice versÃ¢</em>.</p>

<h4>(f) <em>Shilluks.</em></h4>

<p>From Kodok south, on the right bank, to the Sobat the
inhabitants are mostly Shilluks (for description of whom
<em>vide</em> <a href="#p1c08">Chap. VIII.</a>)</p>

<p class="center">(The Sobat and tributaries, and country south of
the Sobat and north of N. Lat. 5Â° between the Bahr El Jebel and
Abyssinian frontier.)</p>

<h3 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c06s1"></a><span class=
"sc">Section 1.âDescription of the Sobat and its
Tributaries</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">River Sobat.</span>The Sobat rises on the
Abyssinian plateau somewhere about east long. 36Â° and north lat. 7Â°
15â², though its source has probably never been accurately
determined, and flows generally from east to west.</p>

<p>For the first 260 miles (approximately), as far west as the
junction of the Pibor<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, it is known by the Abyssinians as the
Baro, by the Nuers as the Kir, and by the Anuaks as the Upeno; from
this point to its junction with the White Nile, at a point some 55
miles by river south of Kodok and 460 miles (approximately) from
its source, it is called the Sobat.</p>

<p>In its descent from the plateau to Gambela, for the first 150
miles, it flows in a series of rapids through wooded, mountainous,
and hilly country, in a rocky bed often not more than 40 yards
wide. From Gambela to Finkio (15 miles) it increases in width to
about 200 yards, but in the dry season is full of rocks, especially
at the bends. Throughout the remainder of its journey to the Nile
it meanders across an immense dead-flat alluvial grassy plain,
varied here and there by extensive woods reaching down to the
waterâs edge, but often nothing is visible for miles save swamp and
grass with numerous termite hills, and but an occasional tree.
During this part of its course its width varies as a rule from 150
to 300 yards, though occasionally it narrows to 30 or 40 yards in
the marshy region between Balamkun and the Pibor.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span>Working up
stream,<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class=
"fnanchor">[87]</a> the banks are, as a rule, firm and dry for the
first 150 miles from Sobat mouth, and numerous villages are seen
built actually on them. The left bank is usually higher than the
right, and both banks are higher than the country in their
immediate vicinity, and thus narrow swamps running parallel to the
river exist well on into the dry season. These marshes are often
drained by the natives through cuts in the banks in order to
capture the fish in them. Above the village of Shwai the banks are
alternately marshy and firm.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Navigability.</span>Both the Sobat and
Baro, probably as far up-stream as Finkio, are navigable for
steamers drawing 4Â½ feet of water, from the middle of May till the
end of December. About the middle of the latter month the
appearance of sandbanks makes navigation difficult, though it is
probable a channel for small boats exists throughout the year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fords.</span>Both the Sobat and Baro are
fordable at fairly frequent intervals in the dry season eastwards
of the Dinka country.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Current.</span>The current is generally
estimated at from 2Â½ to 3 miles per hour in flood; in the dry
season (February to May) it is not more than 1 mile per hour.</p>

<p>The current of the Baro in flood combined with the sharp bends
and occasional narrowness of the river render navigation difficult
in places.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>The water of the Sobat in
flood is of a reddish-yellow colour, whilst that of the Baro is
similar to the colour of the Blue Nile or Atbara, being like them
derived from the Abyssinian hills.</p>

<p>The sources of supply of the Sobat are:â</p>

<p>(i) The southern Abyssinian hills and the rains which drain
westward from them.</p>

<p>(ii) The vast marshes which lie between the White Nile and the
Abyssinian hills, which keep the Pibor bank-full till the middle or
end of January.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise.</span>The Sobat reaches its lowest
level about the end of January and commences to rise about the end
of April or beginning of May.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discharge.</span>Petherick in April (low
water), 1862, estimated the discharge of the Sobat at 120 cubic
metres per second. The same authority on 5th June (after the rise
had begun), 1863, reckoned the discharge at 233 cubic metres per
second. For later calculations, <em>vide</em> footnote <a href=
"#Footnote_68">p. 111.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Adura (loop of the Baro).</span>A large loop of the Baro
takes off from the main stream near the village of Gadjak<a id=
"FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
on the south bank, and enters the Baro again some 14 miles to the
east of the Sobat-Pibor junction. This river is known by the
natives as the Adura. Although seemingly a large and important
loop, it was found to be quite unnavigable in July, when the river
was nearly full, owing to the existence of a large number of
sand-banks and islands. Another loop south of the Adura is said to
be formed by a stream known as the Mokwai. This has a very
insignificant exit from the Baro, only some 5 or 6 miles to the
east of the Adura exit, but is reported in its lower reaches to be
an important stream in flood time, possibly after it is joined (as
it is said to be) by the Bela river. The combined stream enters the
Pibor, by native report, and, in that case, the river, followed by
Major Capper for some 20 miles of its course, is probably this
one.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tribes â Shilluks.</span>From the
junction of the river Sobat with the White Nile, for the first 30
or 40 miles up-stream, both banks of the Sobat are occupied by the
Shilluks. For full description of this tribe, <em>see</em> <a href=
"#p1c08">Chap. VIII.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dinkas.</span>The Dinka tribe thence
occupy both banks of the river Sobat to about 32Â° 16â² east,
villages of first Shilluks and then Dinkas being very numerous from
the Sobat mouth up to this point, which is near the village of
Lajak. They are shy and suspicious, but amenable to kindness and
trade.</p>

<p>The Dinkas of the Sobat have been worsted in the frequent forays
of the more powerful Nuers into their district. They complain
bitterly of the spoliation of their herds by the Nuers, and state
that many of their children, now growing into manhood as Nuers,
were torn from them in the constant raids of the Nuer tribe. The
Dinkas, in spite of this alleged oppression, own large numbers of
sheep, goats, and cattle (<em>vide</em> details Appendix F,
<a href="#Page_330">p. 330</a>). The Dinkas on the Sobat are far
more intelligent and energetic than their kinsmen on the White
Nile, and cultivate sufficient grain and tobacco for their own
needs.</p>

<p>For the most part the Dinka territory along the Sobat consists
of open, treeless, grass plains. Fifteen to 20 miles east of Lajak
the river banks are uninhabited until the small village of Ashel is
reached, which is the commencement of a small tract of Anuak
country, sandwiched in between the Dinkas in the west and the large
and powerful Nuer tribe to the east.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Anuaks (west of Nasser).</span>The small
section of Anuaks referred to here only occupy some 25 to 30 miles
of the river bank as far as the village of Wegin, which is the
boundary between them and the Nuer tribe. The different tribes
hereabouts are considerably intermingled, as they appear to
intermarry<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a> to a large extent, and Anuaks may be found
living amongst the Nuers even as far east as Nasser. Their position
would not, however, appear to be a very enviable one, as the men
are more or less slaves of the Nuers, and are called upon to
perform many household and menial duties for their more powerful
neighbours; at the same time the Anuaks appear to have no fear of
entering Nuer territory.</p>

<p>The chief villages of the Anuaks, between Ashel and Wegin on the
left bank of the river, are Yakwoik, Fatiwanyang and Shwai. A
friendly Sheikh, Aiwel Wad Agwot, lives at Fatiwanyang. He is
constantly to be seen at Nasser Post, and also occasionally even at
Kodok.</p>

<p>This section of the Anuaks is a small and unimportant one; in
general appearance they closely resemble the Nuers. They appear to
grow very little food, barely more than sufficient for their own
requirements, but at the same time have flocks of sheep and goats
and a few herds of cattle.</p>

<p>Their country is well wooded for the most part, and, from native
accounts, numerous herds of elephants constitute a very real source
of danger to travelling, more especially at night time. Game is
plentiful on both banks of the river in December, 1899. Very little
trade has been carried on with these natives, but a few goats and
sheep can be purchased for brass wire; the price being about a
6-foot length of wire for a sheep. Latterly, however, since more
intimate communication with Nasser Post has been established, the
demand for cloth has increased.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nuers (Sobat and baro).</span>The Nuers
are by far the most powerful and numerous tribe living along the
Sobat river. Originally they appear, from native accounts, to have
occupied tracts of country south of the Sobat in the neighbourhood
of Bor and the Bahr El Ghazal, but these sections trekked north,
and ousted the more weakly tribes living on the Sobat, and occupied
their country. The Falangs and Bonjaks no longer exist, their
territory being occupied by the Nuers. There appear to be three
separate factions of Nuers at the present day occupying the Sobat
valley, who, if native accounts are to be believed, are more or
less at enmity with each other, owing to family disagreements. It
is often difficult in consequence to get guides from one part of
the country to enter that occupied by a rival section. For
instance, Sheikh Jokâs people will not readily enter the territory
of the Nuers in the neighbourhood of Nasser Post; whilst these
again will refuse to proceed further east along the Baro than the
village of Barrakwik.</p>

<p>The Nuer territory along the Sobat and Baro rivers extends from
about east 32Â° 33â² to about 34Â° 10â². Their territory on the right
bank of the Baro as far east as the Khor Garre<a id=
"FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
(33Â° 48â² approximately) belongs to the Sudan, whilst east of this
khor and the whole of the left bank of the Baro belongs to
Abyssinia. From Wegin village to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_133">[133]</span> Nasser Post the country is probably the
finest occupied by the Nuers, as it is for the most part well
wooded, and in places one passes through really beautiful park-like
country. Villages are numerous, and several of the districts, such
as Fauwel and Jurwel, are well cultivated. East of the Pibor their
country bordering the Baro is a desolate marsh.</p>

<p>Although the huts and villages of the Nuers hereabouts are well
and substantially built, the natives themselves are shy,
suspicious, indolent and altogether a very low type of humanity.
They appear to cultivate only such small plots of ground in the
immediate vicinity of their villages as will suffice for their own
requirements for perhaps six months in the year, whilst during the
remainder of the year they live chiefly on fish, which, existing in
great quantities, are easily speared during the dry season of the
year. They do not appear to hunt at all.</p>

</div>

<p>Physically, the men are tall and well-built, but show little
signs of muscular development, being generally long-limbed and
wiry. They are all stark naked, and cover themselves from head to
foot with cow dung ash, which gives them a particularly filthy
appearance and renders their skin extremely rough and coarse. They
make no attempt to adorn themselves, but are extremely anxious to
procure brass wire with which to make for themselves bracelets
extending from the wrist to near the elbow. This seems to be about
their only vanity. They are all armed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_134">[134]</span> with spears, of which every man carries two
or three. Their weapon of defence consists of an oval-shaped
buffalo-hide shield. Bows and arrows they do not appear to
possess.</p>

<p>The elder married women are as filthy as the men in appearance.
They all, however, wear a leather apron or skin fastened round
their waists. The younger girls and unmarried women wear no such
covering, and, like the men, are quite naked.</p>

<p>The right bank of the Sobat near Nasser Post is densely
populated as far as the junction of the Sobat and Pibor rivers,
there being several large and important villages such as
Kwoinlualtong, Taufot, and Ajungmir in addition to smaller ones.
The left bank of the Sobat is not inhabited, as from Nasser to the
Pibor a considerable portion of the country is inundated when the
rivers are full.</p>

<p>East of the Sobat-Pibor junction, the country through which the
Baro flows may be described, until Anuak territory is reached, as
worthless. For the most part it consists of open treeless grass
plains, which, in the vicinity of the river, are inundated for
months at a time. The population is small, and confined to villages
some distance apart, and absolutely no signs of cultivation are
seen, except on a large island near the border of Anuak
territory.</p>

<p>This perhaps may be explained by the fact that the Nuers in the
dry season of the year occupy villages near the river banks, which
are merely used as large fishing villages during the time the
rivers are low; they subsist almost entirely then on the fish
speared in the many pools which are formed by the receding waters
of the rivers. When the rivers become full again, and the country
is inundated, they withdraw to their permanent quarters further
inland, where they probably merely cultivate during the rainy
season of the year, between the months of May and November.</p>

<p>Several of the large villages to the east of the Pibor-Sobat
junction, such as Taiyau, Gunjang, Gadjak and others which were
teeming with life in the month of January, were deserted in July
when a visit was paid by steamer to Itang.</p>

<p>With the Nuers of the Sobat and Baro rivers very little trade
can be done, as they possess little or no grain, living chiefly on
fish. They possess, however, numerous flocks of goats and sheep in
the vicinity of Nasser Post, and also some magnificent herds of
cattle at Ajungmir. Thirty-five goats and sheep were obtained in
exchange for a cow. Large opaque white beads, about the size of a
pea, are in request as articles of barter, but brass wire âNo. 8â
is most in demand, and a desire for cloth is beginning to rise.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Anuaks or Yambos (E. of
Nasser).</span>The eastern Anuaks of the Baro (or Ufeno, as they
call it) inhabit that portion of the river bank extending east of
34Â° 10â² to the mouth of the Baro river gorge at the foot of the
Abyssinian hills, and the whole of their territory, with the
exception of a small enclave round Itang,<a id=
"FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
which is leased to the Sudan Government, belongs to Abyssinia.</p>

<p>This tract of country is probably the most fertile anywhere
along the river after it enters the plains. It is well wooded, and
to a great extent free of those large expanses of swamp found lower
down the river in Nuer territory. The numerous huts and hamlets,
with which the river banks are dotted, are generally built close to
the edge of the bank overlooking the river, usually on mounds
slightly raised above the normal level of the bank. These huts are
neatly built of mud and wattle with grass roofs, and are
scrupulously clean and well kept. They are, as a rule, surrounded
by a fence of tall reeds and grass, giving absolute privacy to the
occupants. Within the enclosure so formed, in addition to several
huts for the family, are the granaries, and also other enclosures
for the herding of goats and sheep at night time. The interior is
most carefully plastered over with mud and free of dust and dirt.
The natives of this region are more advanced in ideas of
civilisation than any others living along the Sobat and Baro in the
plains. This is possibly due to their being in closer touch with
the Gallas, with whom they trade considerably, than any of the more
western tribes are.</p>

<p>They are a most peaceful, friendly and industrious race, and are
great agriculturists. Miles and miles along the river banks are
diligently cultivated by them twice a year, and splendid crops
spring up from the generous soil.</p>

<p>Physically the Anuaks are not such a tall race as the Nuers, but
their muscular development is perhaps finer. This is probably due
to their more nourishing grain food all the year round, but they
also supplement their grain largely with fish during the dry
seasons of the year. Although they rarely seem to kill their goats
and sheep for food, like the Nuers, they are extremely fond of
meat, and will constantly beg a white man to come and shoot a
hippopotamus for them, so that they may indulge in a real
gorge.</p>

<p>As a rule the men are more decently clad than the Nuers, as many
of them wear beautifully cured skins, as soft as chamois leather,
round the loins. They are far cleaner, better groomed, and smarter
looking in every way than the Nuers. A large number of the Anuaks,
especially in the neighbourhood of Pokum and Finkio, wear splendid
ivory bracelets on the arms. Some of these are as much as 4 to 5
inches in depth, and it is by no means uncommon to see a man with
one such bracelet on the upper arm, and two somewhat smaller ones
on the fore-arm.</p>

<p>One very curious weapon, to be seen nowhere else, is found among
the Anuaks. This consists of a spear, the head of which is
manufactured from a legbone of a giraffe, polished down to about 1
inch or Â¾ inch in diameter, and sharpened to a fine point. These
curios are obtainable for about five Â½-piastre pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>The Anuaks would
not appear to be either a courageous or warlike race like the
Nuers, and seem content to merely cultivate their fields and remain
at peace with their neighbours. Their spears are generally small
headed, with long handles, and it is by no means unusual to see
some men armed with nothing but sharp-pointed sticks hardened at
the ends. Knobkerries are carried by most men. The older married
women all wear skins, cured or otherwise, round the loins. Some of
these are daintily picked out with a border of vari-coloured small
beads. A large quantity of beads are also very commonly worn both
round the waist and neck. The attire of the younger women and girls
is really most attractive. In addition to a numerous accumulation
of beads round the neck, they wear a large number of strings of
beads round the waist of many different colours, whilst a small
fringe, as it were, of generally white opaque or light blue and
white beads depends in front and behind, some 2 to 3 inches in
length round the body. As the girls are often very beautifully
formed, and possess pleasant, laughing and occasionally really
pretty faces, a group of them together forms a most charming
picture of modest maidenhood.</p>

<p>The upper reaches of the Baro are not well cultivated, and
beyond the point where the <em>Faidherb</em> was abandoned, the
population is very scanty, and little or no food is obtainable from
the natives; the river banks become very stony and thickly wooded,
and what little cultivation there is to be seen hereabouts is
generally on the islands.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Principal villages.
Nasser.</span><span class="sc">Nasser</span>, situated on the left
bank of the Sobat, 160 miles above its junction with the White
Nile, is the residence of a police officer and detachment of
police. It is also garrisoned by half a company of a Sudanese
battalion under a British officer (January, 1904). Little trade is
as yet carried on as the Nuers who live in the vicinity have not
yet got over their aversion to dealings with a civilized
Government.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Itang (Finkio).</span>By the treaty of
May, 1902, the Emperor Menelek agreed to lease to the
Anglo-Egyptian Government an area of about 1,000 acres in the
neighbourhood of <span class="sc">Itang</span>, for the purpose of
forming a trading station there. Itang is on the right bank of the
Baro, roughly 100 miles above Nasser, and is in the Anuak country;
a station was established here in January, 1904. As, however, the
site is not a very suitable one a more convenient one at Finkio
further east has been adopted. The Sheikh of Finkio is named
Ojilo.</p>

<p>Although it is not practicable for probably five or six months
in the year to maintain direct steamer communication with Nasser,
the post should be absolutely self supporting. Shallow draught
steamers drawing say 15 inches could, however, probably reach
Finkio during 10 months of the year.</p>

<p>In addition to grain of various kinds, cotton is also grown by
the natives in small quantities, and tobacco is very commonly to be
obtained. Flocks of goats and sheep are numerous; but the natives
will not readily part with their live stock. Cattle are only to be
seen very rarely, as the natives fear to possess these lest they
should attract the cupidity of the Abyssinians.</p>

<p>The Anuaks are very ready to sell flour and grain in exchange
for beads, more especially in the Finkio district, which is very
largely populated. They also hire themselves readily as
carriers.</p>

<p>The most popular bead is a small light blue opaque one, the only
opaque species of small bead obtainable in Cairo. A string of this
bead, sufficiently large to pass over the head on to the neck, will
purchase from 1 to 1Â½ pounds of flour, and perhaps 2 pounds of
grain. A fowl can also be obtained for about the same quantity of
beads. Possibly white or small green opaque beads would be equally
sought after, but a blue and white bead, known in East Africa as
the âpunda maliaâ (zebra), would, everywhere in these regions, be
eagerly sought after by the natives. Many of the Anuaks wear these
beads, though how this species has got into the country, except,
perhaps, gradually from the north of Lake Rudolf, where they may
have been bartered in 1898, is difficult to understand.</p>

<p>The best trade goods would be white, green, pale blue (all must
be opaque and not glass) and âpunda malia.â Beads would be the main
purchasing medium for grain, and perhaps brass wire and cloth for
goats and sheep.</p>

<p>In a short time money may be introducedâas at Kodok amongst the
Shilluksâas the Gallas, being neighbours of the Anuaks, and
familiar with the Maria Theresa dollar, would readily bring down
goats and sheep for sale, and the Anuaks would probably soon follow
suit.</p>

<p>Besides tapping the fertile food-producing districts of the
Anuaks, trade in ivory, coffee, live stock, donkeys, and mules, and
in addition, perhaps gold and iron, in smaller quantities, will
spring up with the Gallas when they find a ready market for their
goods.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tributaries of Sobat and
Baro.</span>Several more or less important streams and khors join
the Baro in its upper stony region on both banks. Chief of these
are the Sako on the right bank and the Bonga on left bank.</p>

<p>Lower down on the right bank, Khor Jokau or Garre joins the Baro
by, some say, two mouths, one at Jokau about 40 miles west of
Itang, the other at Machar<a id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> 15 miles further west,
where the post to mark the Sudan-Abyssinia frontier has been
erected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The Khor Garre,
which forms the boundary between the Sudan and Abyssinia in these
regions, brings down a large quantity of water in flood time from
the Galla hills. In the dry season water stands in pools in its
bed.</p>

<p>For the first 20 miles from its mouth this khor is inhabited by
or belongs to the Nuers, then for a few miles by the Anuaks or
Yambos, whose district is called Chai, and higher up by Burun.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Khor Makeir.</span>About 8 miles east of
the Pibor junction, Khor Makeir comes in on the right bank. This,
near its mouth, is deep, with a sandy bed 30 yards wide. It has not
been explored, but is believed by some to be the mouth of the
Sonka, in which case it has its origin near Jebel Sonka in the
Galla hills south of Kirin. Others say it is only a spill from the
Baro.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tributaries on left bank. Nigol or
Aluro.</span>The River Nigol (Nuer) or Aluro (Anuak) enters the
Baro about 17 miles below Itang. It appears to have its origin on
the Abyssinian plateau, and for some 25 miles before its junction
with the Baro it flows parallel to that river, at a distance often
of little more than a mile. In flood time it is a most formidable
obstacle, as it forms large areas of swamp. Its entry into the
Baro, near the border between Anuak and Nuer territory, is a very
insignificant one, and barely discernible, as it spills out into a
large swamp, near the village of Methok, before it reaches the
actual river, and apparently the water gradually finds its way into
the river through a thick forest-growth of trees by two small
channels only a few feet wide. From the point where the Adura takes
off from the Baro, the banks of the latter river are thickly wooded
with sycamore and other trees as far as the eastern boundary of
Nuer territory.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Pibor.</span>The Pibor flows generally
from south to north, and enters the Sobat river at a point about 25
miles above Nasser and about 200 miles from its (Sobat) mouth. It
is by far the most important tributary of the Sobat. The Pibor was
found (June, 1903) to be blocked by sudd immediately above the
Akobo junction, and so its upper waters remained unexplored until
September, 1904.<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The greenish colour of its water would
lead one to suppose that it receives its supply from vast marshes
in the plain between the Akobo and the Nile, rather than from the
Abyssinian plateau.<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The banks of the lower Pibor are, as a rule, swampy, especially
at the season when the river is fullest. The adjoining country is
flat and covered with grass, with but few trees, though, south of
Koratong, the banks are firm and dry, and trees become general,
especially on the right bank.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Width.</span>The waterway of the Pibor in
its lower reaches is exceedingly narrow, a steamer frequently
touches the reeds of either bank simultaneously. About 40 miles
from its mouth, however, it widens to from 40 to 100 yards.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Navigability.</span>The Pibor river has
not (1903) been navigated by steamer in the months of February,
March, and April, during which period it appears probable
navigation would be difficult, if not impossible. During the rest
of the year the average depth of water is at least 10 feet.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discharge.</span>The discharge at the
mouth of the Pibor, calculated by Captain H. H. Wilson in October,
1901, worked out at roughly 13,500 gallons per second. The width of
the river here being about 80 yards, of which about 30 yards was
blocked by sudd. The maximum depth was nearly 30 feet, and the
current rather more than 1 mile an hour.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Route.</span>There is a route over
comparatively dry country from Nasser to Waratong (45 miles
approximately).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The inhabitants of the
lower Pibor are Nuers, whose principal villages are a group at
Koratong and another at Kur, both situated on the left bank. These
appear to be the permanent homes of this section (Sheikh Jokâs) of
Nuers, but in the dry season they occupy other villages both north
and south along the Pibor, the most important of which is Bil
(right bank) near the junction of the Gelo River; during this
season Nuers from other districts visit the Pibor for fishing.</p>

<p>The Nuers of the Pibor do not differ in any essential degree
from those of the Sobat and Baro, and are just as disinclined as
their kinsmen to recognise the advantages of civilisation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade goods.</span>Dura was purchased
from the late Sheikh Yoweâs (now Jokâs) people for small white and
dark blue beads, not much larger than a pinâs head. A string
sufficiently large to pass over the head on to the neck purchased
from 1 pound to 1Â½ pounds of unground grain. A spear length of
brass wire, about 9 feet in length, purchased a goat of average
size. Coloured fancy cloth will soon be in much request.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Anuaks.</span>A few Anuaks are found on
the right bank, these are more or less subject to the Nuers. Their
Sheikh is Okwai.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tributaries of Pibor. The Agwei (Gwynn),
or Neubari (Austin), or Ruzi II (Wellby), or Adjouaro
(Faivre).</span>The âAgweiâ River joins the Pibor about 17 miles
south of the Akobo junction. It was found by the Faivre Expedition
(1898), by whom it was named the Adjouaro, to rise in the Southern
Boma hills and to flow northwards to within a few miles of the left
bank of the Akobo, and then bending westwards to flow parallel with
that river to the Pibor, or, as they called it, the Adjouba
(Agibba?). The Agwei was also heard of by Major Austin when
marching through Boma; it was described as a big river and was
named by him the Neubari. It is also probably the same as Wellbyâs
Ruzi II.</p>

<p>In September, 1904, Major Gwynn explored this branch of the
Pibor in a steam-launch for 55 miles from its mouth, when further
progress was arrested by heavy sudd. He describes it as a fine
stream flowing between well-defined banks, averaging 3 feet above
the level of the river in flood and 60 to 80 yards apart. In
places, however, it had overflown its banks and flooded the
adjoining country to a considerable depth. The average width
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> waterway, which
was frequently obstructed by light sudd blocks, was 30 yards, depth
20 feet, and current 2 to 2Â½ miles per hour. The banks of the Agwei
were stated by Anuaks to be inhabited partly by people of their own
tribe and partly by Agibbas. Their description of its upper course
appears to agree with the theory that it is the Neubari, and that
it is connected with the Akobo, as Major Austin surmised, by the
Oboth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Akobo or Juba.</span>The River Akobo
or Juba, which rises in the Domme Hills (Abyssinia) forming part of
the watershed between the River Omo and the Nile, about north lat.
6Â° 30â² east, long. 35Â° 45â², flows generally in a north-easterly
direction, and for the first 100 miles through more or less hilly
country; it then enters the plains and eventually joins the Pibor
about 70 miles from its mouth.</p>

<p>The ill-fated BÃ³ttego struck this river (January, 1897) about 40
miles from its source, and found it to be about 25 yards wide and
about 18 inches deep, its banks being much overgrown with very high
grass which impeded travelling considerably. It was found to be
uninhabited for about 45 miles further west, when the first Anuak
village was reached. This was the most eastern point on this river
reached by Major Austinâs Expedition (1901).</p>

<p>The Akobo river forms the boundary between the Sudan and
Abyssinia in these regions. The following interesting account of
the Akobo and its inhabitants is taken from Major Austinâs
Report:â</p>

<p>âOn our journey south from Nasser, we retraced our footsteps of
the previous year along the River Pibor through Nuer territory
until we reached the junction of that river with the Akobo. Here we
found a small colony of Anuaks settled down for the coming dry
season with a view to carrying out fishing operations, and without
difficulty obtained the services of two guides. For our first two
marches we proceeded east along the river, the banks of which are
somewhat thickly wooded with thorn bush, amidst which, here and
there, we came upon small families of Anuaks enjoying a precarious
kind of existence on fish and the frugal products of the woods.
These natives were all without exception very timid, and generally
had cleared out of their cosy little arbours before the head of the
caravan had reached them. They are very poor and wretched in
appearance, the men being quite naked and possessing very few
adornments.</p>

<p>âThe elderly women merely content themselves with a small
goatskin worn round the waist, whilst the younger women, like the
men, are devoid of covering. They lack the prosperous and smart
bearing of the Ufeno (or Baro River Anuaks), and in general
characteristics closely resemble those of the Gelo.</p>

<p>âSome 30 miles to the east of its junction with the Pibor the
banks of the Akobo become generally very swampy, and the river was
unapproachable at the time we were travelling along it (February).
No villages were seen until we reached long. 33Â° 40â², where there
was a small one, Bor by name, situated at the base of a single
tree, surrounded on all sides by swamp. From near here a track runs
in a southerly direction to Bonjak, reported to be 30 to 40 miles
distant, and no water on the road.</p>

<p>âSettled villages become somewhat more frequent from that point
until the Tedo district is reached. This is fairly thickly
populated on both banks of the river, and for the first time we
came across a considerable amount of cultivation. A large khor
enters the Akobo from the east hereabouts, which probably has its
origin in the Abyssinian highlands, whilst, from the village of
Neum, a broad loop takes off from the Akobo and re-enters that
river again some 5 or 6 miles further north. Up to this point the
country had been chiefly open grass land, very sparsely wooded with
trees, and occasional small groves of lalob, but it now became well
wooded, and the swampy areas less frequent. Small villages were
established at closer intervals, but the natives remained very
timid and suspicious, and it was difficult in consequence to obtain
the services of guides, as the larger number of the inhabitants
concealed themselves on the approach of the caravan.</p>

<p>âThe Anuak territory terminates at the junction of the Akobo and
Ajibur streams, after which comes a long stretch of uninhabited
country extending to the foot of the Boma hills. The district of
Bula, some distance to the east, is reported by the Anuaks to be
inhabited by men of a fair complexionâpossibly Gallas. The Anuaks
of the Akobo possess but few flocks of goats and sheep, and
apparently no cattle. In addition to grain, they probably subsist
to a large extent in the dry season on fish, as fish weirs and
traps are occasionally met with in the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Width, depth, and current.</span>âThe
average width of the Akobo in its lower reaches is 20 yards, and
depth 7 feet, current 3 miles an hour (February); higher up above
Neum its width increases to 40 to 60 yards, and its depth
diminishes to 18 inches. Its banks are generally high and steep. In
its upper portions it flows over a lava bed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Navigability.</span>âSmall dug-out canoes
are also used by the natives for travelling along the river.
Navigation in a small launch would probably be quite possible as
far as Neum for several months in the year. The larger Nile
steamers would most likely be unable to navigate this stream owing
to the extraordinary sharp curves and bends of the river, the
stream when in flood being very swift. It is quite possible,
however, that a powerful launch, drawing, say, 18 inches of water,
might, at full flood time, be able to proceed, perhaps, as far as
Melile, although extreme caution would have to be observed, for in
parts the river flows over a lava bed, whilst in others, fallen
trees in the river might prove dangerous.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discharge.</span>The discharge of the
Akobo near its mouth was calculated by Captain H. Wilson to be
2,185 gallons per second in October, 1901. There was then a clear
waterway 15 yards wide and 14 feet deep, on each side of which were
belts of sudd from 20 to 30 yards wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Ajibur, or Ruzi I.</span>The Ajibur (Austin) or Ruzi I
(Wellby), a small stream rising on the Boma hills, flows northwards
to the Akobo and joins it on the left bank about 80 miles from its
(Akobo) source. Water was standing in pools in its bed in February,
1901.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gelo River.</span>The Gelo River rises in
the Mocha hills (Abyssinian), situate about east long. 36Â°, north
lat. 7Â° 30â², and flows generally in a westerly direction to the
Pibor, which it enters on the right bank 26 miles above its
junction with the Baro.</p>

<p>Mr. Oscar Neumann, who explored this river in 1901, considers it
a very important source of supply of the Sobat, and far more so
than the Akobo river, which he thinks comparatively insignificant.
Mr. Neumann is strongly of opinion that after traversing Lake Tata
the river divides, one branch flowing into the Pibor, as above
stated, the other or others flowing northwards towards the Baro.
Though BottÃ©go seems to have had the same opinion, Major Austin
does not lend much credence to this theory.</p>

<p>Neumann gives the following description of the upper regions
adjoining this river:â</p>

<p>âIn Shekho I found a large river running westwards. I believed
this river to be the Gelo, discovered near its junction with the
Ajuba by the Italian BÃ³ttego, an opinion which was confirmed
afterwards. Travelling became very difficult here. The western
slopes of the south Ethiopian plateau are cut by many deep ravines;
the roads, therefore, were narrow and bad, and many of my mules
became wounded and useless. As it flows westwards, the River Gelo
is lined on both sides by the densest forest. I could march only
about 2 or 3 miles each day, and to cover that distance the men had
mostly to cut the way with axes and bush knives from morning to
noon, after which the caravan was able to proceed. The inhabitants
of this forest are the Mashango, who are very seldom seen, but we
often found large traps made for hippopotami and waterbucks, and
loops made of creepers for monkeys and other small animals going to
the water. Already in Gimirra I had seen, far away to the west, a
long mountain chain running from north to south, called by the
Galla âGurafardaâ that is to say, âhorseâs ear,â from a sharp
double peak in the middle. It took more than three weeks from
Gimirra to reach the point where the Gelo pierces the mountains,
forming magnificent cascades. Some days after passing this gap, I
saw from a bamboo-covered hill in the west a boundless bush and
grass-covered dead flat plain, the plain of the Sobat and the
beginning of the Sudan. Only a few granite hills are scattered over
it. Ascending one of these I saw, far away, a large lakeâLake
Tataâthrough which the River Gelo runs. Here we found the first
villages of the Yambo or Anuak, who were the first true Nilotic
people I met. They are a division of the great Shilluk tribe, which
is spread over the whole Eastern Sudan, and extends southwards to
the east short of Lake Victoria. The few samples I obtained of
their language show that it is scarcely distinguishable from that
of the Kavirondo people on the east shores of Lake Victoria, whose
country I passed on my first African journey in 1894.</p>

<p>âThe land now became more and more swampy. The Anuaks,
poverty-stricken through many Abyssinian ârazzias,â live hidden
away on small islands in these swamps. A large part of the people
have migrated westward, and live in a state of semi-slavery under
the protection of the more powerful Nuer, near the Egyptian fort of
Nasser on the Sobat.</p>

<p>âApproaching Lake Tata the swamps became so numerous and deep
that I turned south and marched to the village Neum, where I struck
BottÃ©goâs route. The attempt to march along the northern bank of
the Akobo failed, because we stuck fast in the swamps, where I lost
many of my mules; so, after two days, I marched back to Neum and
crossed the Akobo. The country on the left shore of the river,
which had here a north-westerly direction, was drier.â</p>

<p>Major Austin, gives an interesting description of the river and
country west of Lake Tata:â</p>

<p>âThe Anuaks of the Gelo river district need very little
description, and, as practically little was seen of them except
when passing their villages, not much information was obtained
regarding them. As compared with their compatriots on the Ufeno
river, they appear to be a far less prosperous race, and,
physically, might be described as an anÃ¦mic-looking tribe, probably
due to the fact that the tract of country they inhabit is for
months at a time one vast swamp, and unhealthy in consequence. They
are more suspicious and shy than the northern section, but not
really unfriendly in any way, as we had no difficulty in obtaining
guides from them. They do not take the same pride in their personal
appearance as those of the Upeno, and few of the men wear skins.
The women are less particular also, and unhesitatingly entered the
river at Patok devoid of all clothing, and washed themselves on the
bank before our men. The unmarried women, like those of the Nuers,
deem it unnecessary to provide themselves with any covering. Beads
are worn, but not in the same quantities nor with the same taste as
further north.</p>

<p>âThe right bank of the Gelo, as far west as about east 33Â° 50â²,
is generally well-wooded some little distance from the river, but
the left bank west of about east 33Â° 50â² is absolutely devoid of a
tree or even almost of a shrub. An open treeless grass plain
appears to extend south until the Akobo river is reached.</p>

<p>âPatok, the first village on the Gelo reached by the survey
party, is one of very considerable size, skilfully concealed in a
thick belt of wood, the interior of which has been cleared to a
large extent. The village is enclosed by a stockade of tree trunks
and branches for defensive purposes.</p>

<p>âMost of the large villages along the Gelo, such as the Otwol,
Chiro, Oran group, Goin, and Ungela are similarly concealed inside
belts of tall trees, and surrounded by stockades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>âThese villages
are situated some distance from the river, as the expanse of swamp
bordering the Gelo prevents villages being built nearer to its
banks. At the height of the rainy season it appears probable that
the whole country north of the Gelo and between that river and the
Baro is one vast swamp, quite impracticable for transport
animals.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Width and current.</span>âThe width of
the Gelo west of Lake Tata varies as a rule from 60 to 100 yards.
At its junction with the Pibor its width is not more than 30 to 40
yards, whilst its current is very swift.</p>

<p>âAs the Gelo is followed along its banks, no other stream
appears to flow into it, although several swampy khors issuing from
the river are crossed, flowing in a northerly direction. These are
reported to join the Bela river and to flow into the Mokwai.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>âAlong the Gelo,
beyond a small patch of cultivation on the river bank near the
village of Patok, no other signs of civilization are evident,
except in a few diminutive cleared spaces in the woods; no food is
obtainable from these natives. That they must subsist on grain to a
large extent appears to stand to reason, so it is possible their
fields, like their villages, are concealed in the midst of woods,
with which the country abounds. Like the Nuers and Anuaks of the
Baro these natives possess small dug-out canoes for crossing the
Gelo, and employ them also in their fishing operations.</p>

<p>âTo the west of Perbong two other villages, Ametha and Otwol,
are reported to exist in Anuak territory hereabouts, and these two
probably depend on wells for their water supply, as they must be
quite 3 to 4 miles distant from the river, and no signs of tracks
leading from or to the Gelo are visible. Goats and sheep are only
seen in very small numbers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Swampy nature of country.</span>âIn
normal years it is doubtful if this tract of country can be
traversed much later than the middle of April with transport
animals,<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a> as once the rains set in the whole country is
rapidly converted into bog, through which laden animals, especially
donkeys, are quite unable to travel. During the dry seasons of the
year large herds of elephants roam over these grassy plains and
find both food and shade in the forest growth on the north bank of
the Gelo. It is to these regions the Abyssinians descend in large
numbers yearly from the western edge of the plateau, on ivory
hunting expeditions, and traces of recent Abyssinian encampments
were on several occasions met with. Before the rains break,
however, these parties return to their homes, and we were warned at
Gore by Fitorari Hili that we would find the country impracticable
for animals once the rains set in, and this we certainly found to
be the case.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">River Mokwai.</span>The River Mokwai or
Bela appears to flow westwards to the Pibor from the Gurafarda
range of hills (Abyssinia) traversing <em>en route</em> the marshy
region between the Baro and Gelo; from the latter river it probably
receives a considerable overflow. Its mouth is supposed to be about
8 miles south of the Pibor-Sobat junction, but owing to swamp it
has not been accurately determined. It is said to be an important
river in flood time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Khor Filus.</span>The Khor Filus enters
the Sobat on the left bank about 10 miles from its junction with
the White Nile, the following description of this khor, the
adjoining country and its inhabitants, is taken from a report by
Captain H. H. Wilson, Inspector, Upper Nile Province:â</p>

<p>â. . . Starting on April 15, 1902, the expedition marched from
the village of Gokjak (some 20 miles from the mouth of the Sobat),
and met the Khor Filus at Shol Ajik, some 8 miles inland, thus
saving an unnecessary long march along the khor from its mouth,
which is 10 miles from the Sobat mouth. The country here is flat
and uninteresting, nothing but a vast grass plain, with hardly a
tree to be seen. At Shol Ajik trees were met with, the banks of the
khor being thinly wooded with a small growth of red âtalh,â with a
sprinkling of the unwelcome âkittrâ thorn bush. The khor at this
point is some 50 to 80 yards in width, mostly, however, filled up
with weeds, the real water channel being clearly marked (though
practically dry) by a deep narrow bed, some 15 feet lower than the
adjacent banks. On to the village of MâYolga the same country
extendsâgrass, with a few trees; in one place there were traces of
elephants which had been there in the rainy season. Other game seen
was the bastard tiang hartebeeste, which was really all the game
seen in any quantity in the country. MâYolga is a long scattered
village on the right bank of the khor, and marks the limit of the
Dinka tribe inland. From here onwards for many miles is uninhabited
country, from Bia to Nerol being thickly wooded, in places densely,
but only occasionally with any undergrowth that makes travelling
difficult. Tiang hartebeeste were seen in considerable numbers
along the whole route, and also quantities of waterfowl, pelicans,
duck, geese, teal, and many and various kinds of crane and heron.
In the vicinity of Fanyanglwel, 46 miles south of Sobat, the first
signs of Nuer habitation were met with in the shape of their cattle
âferiks,â which are the summer residences (<em>i.e.</em>, dry
season, from January to May), built close to water, and constructed
lightly of grass only. No regular huts or tukls were met with until
reaching Riul, 7 miles further south, where the banks became low
and flat, and trees only at some distance on either side. The khor
is here in the rains evidently broad and shallow, and, owing to
mud, probably an impassable obstacle under such conditions.</p>

<p>âA noticeable feature in the Nuer tukls is the superiority of
their construction compared with the tukls of the Dinkas, Anuaks,
and other tribes of the Sobat, their cattle tukls being in many
cases marvels of constructive art, given<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_140">[140]</span> only boughs of trees, grass, and native
tools for their building. The regular solidly-built villages are
placed at varying distances from the khor, probably dependent on
high ground and on the nature of the soil, if suitable for the dura
crops or otherwise, which are always grown in the vicinity of the
rainy season tukls. Another noticeable feature, differing from the
Shilluk and Dinka customs, was that the villages are not compactly
built. The Shilluks and Dinkas generally build their tukls in close
proximity, each village being a thick cluster of huts, the dura
being sown anywhere close by. In the Nuer case, the tukls are built
in twos and threes, at great intervals, probably each family being
separate; the land around each homestead being sown and tilled by
the dwellers therein. In the case of many Nuer villages, owing to
the village being built in the woods, and the groups of tukls at
intervals of 200 to 600 yards, it was impossible to estimate the
size of the village without covering many square miles of country.
Around the various large pools of water near Meinom, Fading, and
Shit, were thick fringes of âAmbachâ; these pools, being the chief
source of supply for men and cattle in the dry season, it is only
natural to have found the water so churned up and fouled by the
cattle as to be nearly undrinkable. In places near these pools,
where the adjacent soil was sandy, wells had been dug to obtain a
cleaner supply of water. From Shit the khor continues in a
southerly direction, being broad and shallow, and it is said, runs
on to Bor. The expedition left the khor at Shit, and, relying on
native assurances that water would be found in wells, pushed inland
to the east, and marched through the main Nuer villages, which were
in places very thickly dotted about, and well built. The country
from Shit to the limit of the march was well wooded, chiefly with
the heglig tree. The ground rose slightly, and as one got inland it
became sandy and covered with fine grass, standing 2 to 4 feet
high. The country also, here, struck one as being presumably fairly
healthy in the rainy season, there being a complete absence of any
rank vegetation. The dura crops in April were just appearing, the
young shoots being about 6 inches high, and a very considerable
extent of ground around each village was under cultivation.</p>

<p>âAt Amwot-el-Sogheir, another fairly large khor was crossed; it
was, however, quite dry, and the expedition camped on the further
side, alongside some wells, which it was learned were the only ones
to be found in this part of the district. These wells were worth
noticing: dug on the sandy banks of the khor, their depth varied
from 20 to 30 feet, with a diameter of about 2 feet 6 inches. Owing
to the solidity of the ground, the walls of the well stood without
need of revetting, and great labour must have been expended in
their construction. Steps were cut in the wells on opposite sides,
to enable a man to descend and ascend. In one of the wells a calf
was seen, standing in the water at the bottom, having evidently
fallen in. It was rescued by one of the Dinka guides, who descended
the well without difficulty, and brought up the animal unhurt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Denkur.</span>âFrom the camp an
expedition was made on the 22nd to the Nuer villages in this
vicinity, which were stated to be the headquarters of the chief
sheikh of the Nuers of the whole country under notice, by name of
Denkur. Marching through a fairly thick forest of âAbu Homeraâ
trees for an hour, and afterwards over an open grass plain for
another hour-and-a-half, brought us up to the village, Keik.
Standing in the centre of the village, and seen for about 3 miles
off, was a conical mound of earth, well and solidly constructed by
Denkurâs people as a token that Denkur was a very big man in that
part of the world. It was stated that the bones of innumerable oxen
were buried in the body of the mound; the cattle being slaughtered
for the occasion. This act was to give greater value to the cone in
the eyes of the surrounding tribes, as cattle are the most valued
possessions of the tribes of the White Nile, and are practically
all they live for; in fact, what religion they possess is centred
in the cow. The height of this conical mound was about 50 to 60
feet, many large elephant tusks being firmly planted round the base
and on the summit. The largest tusk measured 7 feet 10 inches, but
of poor quality, as long exposure to rain and sun had ruined the
ivory.</p>

<p>âHaving thus traversed as much of this country as was possible
on account of water, the party returned to the Sobat by the same
route, and arrived on the river bank on May 2. Owing to the extreme
shyness of the Nuers, it was difficult to collect much information
of their customs. <span class="sidenote">Dress, hair,
&amp;c.</span>Like all tribes of the Sobat, they are stark naked,
and owing to their living in their own country, unmolested and out
of all possibility of being in touch with civilization, it is only
natural that they are sunk in barbarism and retain to the full all
the inherited customs of their savage ancestors. Their hair is left
to grow to a length of about 10 inches, and is stained red with the
ammonia contained in the dung and water of their cattle. Their
bodies (of the men) are covered with the white ash of burnt
cow-dung, like the Dinka tribe. This results from the men always
sleeping in separate tukls, the floor of which is several inches
deep with this white ash, resulting from the perpetually burning or
smouldering fire of cow-dung inside the tukl; the men actually make
their bed in the ashes. The women do not thus cover themselves, but
sleep on mats made of dressed cow-hide, and keep their own skins
oiled and clean. The young unmarried girls, like the men, wear no
covering, but the married women wear a loin cloth of whatever
material is available, a leopard, gazelle, or sheep skin.
<span class="sidenote">Weapons.</span>The arms of the men consist
entirely of spears (throwing) and shields, with the universal
knob-kerry; bows and arrows are possessed by a very fewârifles they
have none. It was reported that one of the big sheikhs possessed
himself of a few at one time, but broke them up and made bracelets
for his ladies. As I have mentioned above, the main wealth of the
Nuers lies in their cattle and flocks of sheep. As the importance
or otherwise of a man is gauged entirely by the number of his
cattle, it follows that the quickest way to become powerful is for
an individual or a village to appropriate the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[141]</span> cattle of another individual or a
village, or better still, of another tribe, and thus little raids
of this kind are not infrequent.</p>

<p>âAt Nerol another khor joins Khor Filus, by name Khor Nerol, or
Chirol, which is said to connect with the village of Nyandeng, on
the Sobat. Owing to lack of water, it was found impracticable to
explore any distance up this khor.â</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Section 2.âThe Country South of the Sobat and
North of N. Lat. 5Â° between Bahr El Jebel and Abyssinian
Frontier</span>.</h3>

<h4 class="space-above1"><a id="p1c06s2a"></a>(a) <em>General
Description.</em></h4>

<p>The country included in the above limits comprises an area 300
miles by 200, which, except along its eastern, northern, and
western margins, still remains practically virgin soil untrodden by
a white man.</p>

<p>Our only direct information regarding the interior of this
region is furnished by the Faivre Expedition (1898) which followed
the course of the Pibor for about 60 miles above the Akobo
junction, by the expedition (1902) led by Major A. Blewitt, which
marched nearly due south up the banks of the Khor Filus for about
70 miles, and by Lieutenant Comyn<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> who explored the so-called
Pibor for 170 miles beyond the Akobo junction in September,
1904.</p>

</div>

<p>Except perhaps in the extreme south the whole of this area seems
to be a flat alluvial grassy plain, during the rains, marshy and
liable to be inundated by the various canal-like watercourses
traversing it generally from south to north, but during the dry
season probably arid and waterless for considerable stretches. In
the south the forest is perhaps finer and more generally
distributed than further north, where thin belts of the ubiquitous
heglig, kittr, and talh occasionally vary the monotony of this vast
grass-covered plain.</p>

<p>Though a flat and somewhat unattractive country to the explorer,
there is more than one interesting problem awaiting solution, chief
of which is the Pibor question.<a id="FNanchor_96b"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The course of the mysterious Oquelokur which drains the northern
slopes of the Latuka hills and the Kos, its supposed affluent after
entering the Sudan, also awaits investigation. When Captain Borton
visited the Beri at J. Lafol at the foot of which, according to
existing maps, the Kos should flow, he could see or hear nothing of
this stream. At Bor, too, nothing has been seen or heard of any
large khor for at least 15 miles inland, though the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> natives there say the Beir
tribe live on a large khor three or four days to the east. It seems
therefore probable that the so-called Oquelokur flows further east
than is shown on maps, and that it and possibly the Kos drain into
the Pibor and thence into the Sobat.</p>

<p>With regard to the source of the Khor Filus, the only
information that has been obtained emanates from natives living
near its mouth, who vaguely say it âcomes from Bor,â the reputed
starting point of the other large khors Nifar, Diar, and Gaweir
(perhaps different names for the same khor), which are said to flow
northwards between the Filus and Bahr El Zeraf. Mr. E. Grogan
certainly crossed several wide lagoons or spills just north of Bor,
so possibly what the natives say regarding the origin of these
khors is correct. For description of the Khor Filus, <em>vide</em>
<a href="#Page_139">p. 139.</a></p>

<p>As regards the inhabitants of the interior, all we know is that
the Nuers live on the Khor Filus as far south as 8Â° north latitude,
that the Beri or Beir tribe live some 50 to 80 miles east of the
Nile between Bor and Uganda, and that the Agibba tribe live on the
so-called Upper Pibor, apparently only some 60 miles east of
Bor.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c06s2b"></a>(b) <em>Bahr El Zeraf.</em><a id=
"FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>Bahr El Zeraf is the name
given to the eastern branch of the Bahr El Jebel, which leaves that
river somewhere in the neighbourhood of Shambe, and flows into the
Bahr El Abiad or White Nile near Tonga, about 100 miles up-stream
of Kodok. It has not been navigated in recent years above a point
about 180 miles from its junction with the White Nile. Here it
opens out into several channels and lagoons, which are for the most
part blocked with sudd, and it is difficult to determine which is
the main channel. According to native report a through channel to
the Bahr El Jebel, navigable for steamers at high Nile, does exist.
Whether such is the case has not yet been ascertained.</p>

<p>The general direction of the river is from S.S.W. to N.N.E. The
current is much stronger at the head waters of the river than in
its lower reaches, except where it flows into the White Nile, which
it does through a narrow channel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Width. Depth.</span>The river averages
about 60 yards in width, and nowhere does navigation present any
difficulty until nearing the sudd region. Its depth is generally 5
to 10 feet or more, even at low Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.</span>The rise and fall of the
Bahr El Zeraf is considerable. In May the banks, which are then
hard and steep, are from 5 to 10 feet above the level of the river,
which at high Nile, in spite of the opening of the Bahr El Jebel
channel, appears still to overflow its banks almost everywhere.
This has, no doubt, killed the trees close to the old channel,
masses of dead stumps being a feature of the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>The country inland in May is
dry and level, affording good going, but the only path near the
river and parallel to it passable at all seasons of the year is
said to be on the left bank. This runs from opposite Tonga on the
White Nile up the left bank and crosses to the right bank near
Ajiung thence up the right bank to the neighbourhood of Bor. During
the dry season water along this route is said to be scarce. The
right bank is said to be impassable owing to swamps and elephants.
Mr. Grogan, however, followed the right bank from Ajiung to the
White Nile, and in April, 1904, Captain J. S. Liddell marched
without difficulty with camels from Khor Attar to Twi, leaving the
Zeraf about 20 to 30 miles to the west. Much of the country
traversed, but at this season dry, had been flooded to a depth of
18 inches by the overflow of a large khor to the east named Gaweir.
The road followed is chiefly used by the Dinkas in the rains, as in
the dry season water, which is stored in fulas, is scarce.</p>

<p>The banks of the Zeraf are almost invariably fringed with Um
Suf, a few yards wide.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sudd.</span>Most of the sudd in the lakes
at the head of the river appears to be growing, though on the edges
it is floating and liable to become detached at any time; this is
specially noticeable on the western lake or head of the river. The
water is strongly discoloured after the 100th mile, and gets more
so as the end of the navigable water is reached. Hippopotami,
though scarce on the lower reaches, are very numerous on the higher
ones, and in the many lagoons through which the channel flows.</p>

<p>The sudd is of three kinds:â</p>

<p>(1) Sudd growing up from bottom and immovable.</p>

<p>(2) Small low floating sudd in large patches, but loosely
hanging together, and easily broken up or pushed away.</p>

<p>(3) Patches of high sudd floating and connected by very fibrous
roots, and very difficult to separate or clear; very liable to
entangle in the stern wheel of steamer.</p>

<p>The first and second can be steamed through with difficulty. The
latter has to be cut to pieces by hand and disintegrated.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wood.</span>Between 30th and 148th miles
there is no place where wood can be cut, except by cutting it in
water (October, 1898). Beyond that, there is no wood at all.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The inhabitants of the
island formed by the Zeraf, Jebel, and White Nile are Nuers, who
also occupy the right bank of the Zeraf from its mouth to about
opposite Shambe. The right bank appears to have been
originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
inhabited by Dinkas, of whom a few are still to be found living
among the Nuers, whilst the hinterland of the right bank of the
Zeraf is still occupied by them. They, however, live in dread of
the Nuers, and many of them have left their villages and have
sought safety on the river Sobat.</p>

<p>The Nuers are very shy, but having got over their first timidity
on meeting strangers they are cheery and open-hearted, evincing
none of that suspicion and churlishness which is such an
ever-present characteristic of the Dinkas, even in the more
northern districts, nor that inexpressible laziness, a trait of
both Dinkas and Shilluks.</p>

<p>The men, boys, and unmarried women are, of course, naked. The
married women wear loin cloths of skin, and a few of the men
leopard skins. They all affect the long red-dyed hair, the
universal custom of the Nuer tribes.</p>

<p>The following is a detailed description of the various Nuer
districts on both banks of the Bahr El Zeraf as far as is at
present known (taken from a report by Captain H. H. Wilson,
1903):â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lak.</span>The first district on entering
the Zeraf is Lak, of which the head Sheikh is Fador Wad Koing
(1903). His country is of great extent, and split up into various
sub-districts. This district extends between the Zeraf, Bahr El
Jebel, and White Nile, near Tonga, the majority of the villages and
people being nearer the Bahr El Jebel than the Zeraf. Only a very
small proportion of them winter on the latter river, the majority
do so on the White Nile, up-stream of the mouth of the Zeraf. The
chief village of Lak, and in which Fador himself resides, is called
Fulwal, and is close to the Bahr El Jebel.</p>

<p>The only sub-district of Lak which is on or near the Zeraf, is
Warao, of which the Sheikh is one Warao Wad Koing. This
sub-district is entirely on the right bank of the Zeraf, at about
50 miles from its mouth, the winter hunting village being situated
about 1 mile inland, on the right bank of a big khor known as Bahn,
which runs into the Zeraf at this point. The inland village where
the people reside during the rains and grow their crops, is about
two hoursâ march inland, and is called Fulfam; the sheikh himself
resides in this village.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Thiang.</span>The district of Thiang is
also a large one, being situated on both the right and left banks
of the Zeraf, at or about 80 miles from the mouth. The head Sheikh
is Toi Wad Thief<a id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, who has two big villages, both on the
left bank, called respectively, Fakoi and Fai-at. The people living
on the right bank spread themselves between the Zeraf and Jebel
rivers, and in the winter descend to the banks of either or both of
these rivers to graze their cattle. The people on the right bank
have their ârainâ village at a place called Khandak, about three
hours inland on the right bank at 80 miles. The Sheikh of this
section is called Deng. These people are great hunters of the
elephant.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gaweir.</span>The villages of this
district are seen from the river at about 120 miles, standing about
1 to 2 miles back, with a thick belt of trees behind them; just
north of these trees are seen several clumps of deleib palms, and a
few solitary dom palms. This district is on the left bank entirely,
as far as could be ascertained. The Sheikh of the district is one
Nyal Wad Jek<a id="FNanchor_98b"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class=
"fnanchor">[98]</a>, a young man well disposed to the Government,
and who has only recently succeeded his father as sheikh. He is
very well supported by his uncle, Niar Wad Koing, an elderly man.
These people remain in the same place all the year round; the
ground being sufficiently high to admit of their building their
rain villages in proximity to the river. This was the furthest
point visited by Captain Wilson (1903). The information regarding
the remaining district is from hearsay.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fasheikh.</span>This is the district
ruled over by Sheikh Diu, who, being an influential man in these
parts, is known by this name only. He rules his own district only,
and has nothing to do with the other Nuer districts above
mentioned, each of which is independent, under its own sheikh. This
district lies in the upper region of the Zeraf on the east bank,
and the name Fasheikh applies to the inland district, where Diu and
his people reside in the rains, as opposed to the village of
Ajiung, which is the winter village.</p>

<p>The history of Diuâs occupation of this district is interesting,
and was supplied by several men, who may be quoted as local
authorities. In the days of the old Government it was a large Dinka
district, the chief sheikhs of which were two men well known to the
present Government, <em>i.e.</em>, Aiung Yor and Agweir Owae, who
are, at the present time, settled on the left bank of the Sobat, at
MâYolga, <em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_139">p. 139.</a> At that
time, Diu was somewhere on the Bahr El Jebel, and the Nuer sheikh
on the Zeraf was one Bil Wad Teng, who lived at the spot that is
pointed out as the zeriba of Kuchuk Ali, the Khartoum trader. The
two lived together, the trader probably working the country under
the guidance of the sheikh. On the retirement of the Government
from these parts and the disappearance of Kuchuk Ali, Diu came down
and seized the Dinka country to the south of this spot, turning out
the Dinkas under the above-mentioned sheikhs, and establishing
himself as the paramount power in the district. He is stated to
consider himself a âfakirâ in the same way as Denkur; but that he
is not hostile to the Government is clear from the fact that he
sent his representatives to Kodok last year.</p>

<p>Fasheikh is stated to be about three hoursâ march inland from
Ajiung, but inaccessible owing to the intervening swampy
ground.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span><a id=
"p1c06s2c"></a>(c) <em>R. Awai or Atem.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">River Atem.</span>An important branch of
the Bahr El Jebel appears to leave the main stream through the
swamp and sudd to the north of Bor, and to flow north-west parallel
to it and at a distance of perhaps 5 or 6 miles to the east. For
about 30 miles below Bor, this branch, known by the Dinkas of Pabek
as the river Atem, and by those at Tau as the Awaiâthe âGertrude
Nileâ of Groganâis said to be blocked by sudd. The Dinkas, however,
say that Arabi Dafaalla sent a steamer down it from Bor to the
junction of the Mading. In May, 1904, Sir William Garstin,
G.C.M.G., and Captain J. S. Liddell explored this river by steamer
as far up-stream as the village of Tau within 40 miles of Bor. At
Tau the natives said it was blocked by sudd 10 miles further south.
Up to this point the river was never less than 4 feet deep, though
its breadth varied considerably, and to enable a steamer with
barges to pass through it would require a certain amount of
clearing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">River Mading.</span>About 55 miles below
Bor the Atem or Awai bifurcates. One branch known as the R. Mading,
flowing north, is at first a fine river 80 yards wide and 5 or 6
feet deep but quickly narrows and looses its water in the marshes,
and after 7 miles becomes an insignificant stream. It is said to be
completely blocked by sudd a little lower down.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">River Awai.</span>The main branch known
only as the Awai bends westwards and flows as an easily navigable
stream, though difficult for a steamer with two barges, through the
usual reedy swamp to the lakes a little north of Shambe. Between
the Mading and Shambe the Awai has two main outlets into the Bahr
El Jebel. One from Fajak, navigable only for dugouts, spills into
the main river near Abu Kuka, but the principal channel, only a few
hundred yards long connecting with the Jebel, is about 8 miles
up-stream of Shambe. This is easily navigable by steamers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.</span>The banks of the Awai and
Mading are generally swamp, papyrus or grass, but from the former,
about 7 miles from the Mading junction, ant hills on more or less
dry ground are visible. On the eastern bank of the Atem forest
approaches the river and for 10 miles north of Tau the right bank
is high and firm, though liable to be flooded. The western bank is
everywhere swampy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The Nuers do not
appear to extend south of the latitude of Shambe. Here the banks of
the rivers are thinly populated by Dinkas. From a few miles north
of the Mading junction to Tau is the Dinka district of Twiâit was
with the people of this district that Mr. Grogan had some trouble
in 1900. Sheikh Gurung of Pabek in the north of Twi seems, however,
very friendly. South of Tau, Bor district commences, the Dinkas of
which are said to be not on friendly terms with Twi.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c06s2d"></a>(d) <em>Bor and South.</em><a id=
"FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class=
"fnanchor">[99]</a></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bor.</span>There are three sites on the
right bank of the Bahr El Jebel known as Borâthe most northern is
the site of the Old Government Mudiria, 4 miles further south is
Arabi Dafaallaâs deim, and about the same distance still further
south is the site of the present Military Post and the proposed
site of the Headquarters of the new administrative district of Bor,
<em>vide</em> pp. <a href="#Page_76">76,</a> <a href=
"#Page_77">77.</a></p>

<p>The bank at all three places is high and firm, but the most
roomy landing place is at the most southern site. Wood is
everywhere plentiful, as the forest comes down to the waterâs
edge.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The inhabitants in the
neighbourhood of Bor are Dinkas who live mostly 10 to 15 miles
inland. The principal sheikh (Being-Dit) is named Bor, whose
village is about 10 miles east of the Dervish deim. Sheikh Kur
living about 7 miles north-north-east of Bor is also an important
man.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Being Dit.</span>The office of head
sheikh (Being Dit) is said to have been from time immemorial in the
family of sheikh Bor. It is customary for the Being Dit to nominate
his successor from among his near relatives, his selection
depending on their individual ability. In the present case, though
the eldest son of the Being Dit usually succeeds, sheikh Bor has
disregarded the claim of his own two sons, and has nominated Majam,
son of his deceased brother, Matj.</p>

<p>If the Being Dit dies suddenly without nominating his successor,
an assembly is held to appoint one, a curious fact being that the
women, especially the wives of the late Being Dit, have a good deal
to say in the selection.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Justice.</span>Owing perhaps to the
weakness of the central authority, sheikh Bor, there seem to be
practically no penalties for offences. The fine of one cow appears
to be considered sufficient for any crime from murder downwards.
Capital punishment is never awarded. In the case of theft, the
misdemeanant, if traced, is merely ordered to restore the stolen
property. This he sometimes does and sometimes does not.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villages.</span>The houses of the
villages are much scattered, which renders the occupants very
defenceless in case of raids by the dreaded Beir or Beri tribe
under sheikh Lom, who lives several days further inland in a
south-easterly or easterly direction.</p>

<p>The tukls are well and neatly built, the walls being made of mud
or dura stalks covered with daub. The doorway usually leads into a
sort of hall or porch about 3 to 4 feet high; this again has an
inner door. This is said to be for protection against hyenas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The usual
buildings of a family consist of one tukl (Ud) per wife, one extra
large tukl (Luak as cow stable, and the âGuâ or granary, a kind of
miniature tukl raised off the ground on wooden legs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>In the rains water is
stored in fulas, as the water in these gets low, a series of
circular holes, 2 or 3 feet deeper than the fula, are dug round its
circumference, and the remainder of the water is drained into them.
These holes are then thatched with dura stalks, and water is
economised by thus diminishing the loss by evaporation, as well as
by draining the wet mud at the bottom of the fula.</p>

<p>When these holes run dry water has to be carried by the women
often 10 miles or more from the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Communications.</span>From Bor a dry
road, though not yet explored, undoubtedly leads north to Twi or
Twich. A good path with rest-houses at frequent intervals leads
south up the right bank to Mongalla and Gondokoro.</p>

<p>Communication with the Aliab, a tribe rich in cattle and grain,
living on the west bank opposite to and south of Bor, is maintained
by dugouts to Uternau, thence by road to Sheikh Anok, Mek of the
Aliab, who lives about 25 miles west of Bor Military Post.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>A good deal of dura is
grown by sheikhs Bor and Kur. It is of the white variety and of
excellent quality. The Dinkas are great smokers, and cultivate
sufficient tobacco for their requirements.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle and sheep.</span>Large numbers of
cattle (Wong) and a good many sheep (Amal) and goats (Biu) are
owned by these Dinkas. The grazing stables or cattle zeribas are
called âMura.â The price (Tiek) of a wife used to be five cows or
forty goats. Cattle being now scarce, owing to Arabi Dafaallaâs
prolonged residence at Bor, the price of a wife has been reduced to
one cow.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arms.</span>Bows (Danga) and arrows
(Juet) are in general use, and are looked upon as the principal
weapon for fighting, as their lances are indifferently
manufactured.</p>

<p>Some of the wood from which the bows are made is said to come
from Dar Fertit; the arrows are made of cane with iron or hard-wood
points, and are poisoned by soaking them in the milky juice (Byol)
of the <i>Euphorbia candelabrum</i>, which grows hereabouts.</p>

<p>The Dinkas are very inexpert smiths, and so generally have their
lances made by the Jurs and Aliab of the west bank in exchange for
sheep or goats.</p>

<p>In addition to their bows and spears they usually carry an ebony
club.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ornaments.</span>Iron bracelets (Lung
Kok) are made locally. These are about the only things a Dinka
smith can make. A Dinka receives his bracelets on coming of age and
is then not allowed to part with them.</p>

<p>Ivory bracelets (Gong) are only occasionally seen, as these
people are not great hunters, though elephants are very numerous in
their country.</p>

<p>The Jenotor<a id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a> (Guainakwach) are the favourite beads,
but they are very particular as to the kind. The most popular are
black with red and white spots. Forty of these beads make a
necklace and will purchase a sheep or goat; five is the price of a
hen and three will buy five eggs.</p>

<p>Brass wire is not nearly so much appreciated as iron or the
right sort of beads. It is hammered into bracelets by the smiths,
but they prefer to buy these ready made.</p>

<p>Goat skin bracelets are also worn by the men as well as by the
women who wear, in addition, brass bracelets round the wrists and
ankles, and strings of small blue or white beads round the waist.
The men as a rule are naked, whilst the women wear the usual skin
apron in front and occasionally behind. At present cotton cloth is
considered a prohibitive luxury and is not of much use as barter,
though acceptable as a present.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Word of greeting and language.
Habits.</span>The word of greeting is âAkingedoâ and the reply to
this is the same word repeated.</p>

<p>The dialect of these southern Dinkas varies considerably from
that spoken in the northern districts.</p>

<p>The Dinka is so abnormally lazy that he has no desire whatever
to hire himself for work of any description. Carriers are most
difficult to obtain from them even when applied for through the
medium of their most influential sheikhs.</p>

<p>At certain seasons they are busily occupied with their
cultivation, but for the remainder of the year, with the exception
of the few engaged in superintending the grazing of the cattle,
they live in absolute idleness, varied only by an occasional and
generally futile hunting or fishing expedition.</p>

<p>The women on the other hand are very industrious. On them falls
the heavy work of pounding the dura into flour and preparing food
and other household duties, as well as carrying water which has
often to be brought from a great distance. Salt is not eaten by the
Dinkas, nor is it sought after like sugar, and they do not appear
to have any substitute for it. The women usually drink milk
flavoured with cowâs urine, but the men as a rule drink it
unadulterated.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>As is stated on <a href=
"#Page_128">p. 128,</a> the Dinka believes in a Creator of the
world and mankind known as Deng-Dit. It was only after man had
learnt to sacrifice cattle and sheep to Deng-Dit that woman became
fruitful and man was able to propagate his species.</p>

<p>The Dinkas have regular priests (Tieit) who are not, however,
professional men, but live and work like the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_146">[146]</span> ordinary individual. These priests are
believed to have supernatural powers of conversing with those who
are dead and have become the children of Deng-Dit.</p>

<p>This communion with the dead is held on the occasion of a
ceremony to commemorate the deceased or sometimes in cases of
serious illness.</p>

<p>Mr. R. TÃ¼rstig gives the following interesting description of
these ceremonies:â</p>

<p>âIt was the memorial day for a deceased wife of sheikh Bor. At
about 7 a.m. he and some of his people went to the tukl, which had
belonged to her, and sat down in front of the doorway; on the other
side near the âGuâ or granary sat the deceased wifeâs âlocum
tenensâ as well as other wives. In the open space between them the
Tieit or priest sat on his cow-hide mat. Close by was a tree from
which the branches had been shorn, and to which a large number of
cow-horns had been affixedâsaid by sheikh Bor to be a very old
erectionâand to the bottom of the tree a live goat was
fastened.</p>

<p>âSheikh Bor and his people then commenced to question the priest
on many points with regard to which they desired the opinion of the
deceased wife; the priest meanwhile sat with legs crossed
supporting his head with one hand, whilst with the other he
continued to rattle a bottle-shaped-gourd half-full of lubia beans.
After much shaking and rattling he proceeded, having first directly
addressed the deceased and having made a suitable pause to enable
her to reply, to give a detailed answer on each question in a deep
guttural tone, his eyes meanwhile being rigidly fixed on the
ground, his voice (similar to a ventriloquist) sounding as though
it were not his own.</p>

<p>âThough I was unable to understand much that was being said,
one, at least, of the questions and answers referred to the
approaching visit of the Mudir.</p>

<p>âHaving obtained all the information required, sheikh Bor rose,
the priest remaining seated, seized the sheep, threw it down, and
then slowly and solemnly cut the throat of the animal with a lance,
remaining himself the while in an upright position. The blood
having spurted out, the ceremony was over, and the old sheikh said
âNow let us go to your house.â</p>

<p>âOn another occasion a somewhat similar ceremony took place in
connection with a sick man. The same priest officiated, but there
were more people, and it lasted from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. A good deal
of dancing was performed by women who were decked in fantastic
fashion with ostrich feathers, etc. One woman carried a gourd full
of liquid butter, with which she anointed in most liberal fashion
the necks of those present as well as the entire body of the bull
which was subsequently sacrificed. The priest invariably receives
the ribs of the animal as his portion, but in this case no one
partook of any of the flesh until 5 a.m. the following morning. On
the whole, the Dinkas did not strike me as a particularly
superstitious race.â</p>

<p><em>Vide</em> also Chap. VII, <a href="#Page_162">p. 162,</a>
and compare with Shilluk religion, <a href="#p1c08">Chap.
VIII.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Baris.</span>On the right bank, 20 miles
south of Bor, the Baris begin and extend to Gondokoro and south.
The Sudan Baris appear to be a poor race both materially and
mentally. At present they are neither willing to work to increase
their cultivation, nor to act as porters. In the days of Baker they
were a warlike race, rich in cattleâthis spirit and property seem
to have vanished under Dervish rule. They appear physically
stronger and better built than the Dinkas. Like them they do not
appear to inhabit the country more than 20 miles inland. Their
inland villages have no wells, but each house has usually five pits
dug round it for collecting rainwater. The Baris cultivate dura,
simsim, telabun and tobacco. During the last few years their crops
have suffered much from drought and floods alternately.</p>

<p>Beads are of little use as trade goods. Brass wire, hoes, iron,
and tarbushes, as well as native cotton-cloth (damur) are all
acceptable.</p>

<p>The men as a rule carry a long narrow-bladed spear, and go about
stark naked. The women wear a leather fringe round the loins, with
a tanned skin hanging down behind. The unmarried girls are content
with the fringe only.</p>

<p>The women carry their babies on their backs, in skin bags, which
can be detached and hung on a cross stick to form a cradle.</p>

<p>The principal Sheikhs of the Bari living on the right bank and
working south are Kula, Wungo, Lefo Abu Kuka, Legi Lefo, Lado, and
Lowala, and on the left bank Mudi, Wani, and Lado Kanga. They have
apparently no tribal organization, and the Sheikhs have very little
authority.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mongalla.</span>Mongalla is the
southernmost post of the Sudan Government on the White Nile. It was
moved here from Kiro, on the left bank, in April, 1901. It is the
residence of a British Inspector and Police Officer; there is also
a detachment of two companies under a British officer furnished
from the Sudanese battalion at Taufikia. There are here Government
offices, barracks, hospital, and residences of officials built of
brick. A gunboat is always stationed here. Mongalla is on the right
bank, 23 miles north of Gondokoro, and 13 and 12 miles from the
Belgian stations, Lado and Kiro respectively.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rains.</span>The rainy season in this
district is spread over the period from the end of February to
November, but during<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_147">[147]</span> this season rain is by no means constant.
At first there are intervals of a week or even a fortnight between
the rainstorms, but after the middle of June, when the heavy rains
commence, there is, as a rule, one storm during every 24 hours.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Temperature.</span>The temperature in
these regions is comparatively cool, and the thermometer very
seldom rises to 100Â° Fahr.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Health.</span>The natives appear healthy,
and there seems no reason why, with ordinary precautions, white
races should not enjoy equally good health, though the more
southern portions, at any rate, of this district are certainly
within the âBlackwaterâ fever zone.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c06s2e"></a>(e) <em>The Beri Tribe.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Description.</span>The following
information is taken from a report by Captain N. T. Borton, who
visited these people in April, 1904.</p>

<p>The Beri tribe appear to be a mixture of the Bari and Latuka.
They live on a hill about 2,000 feet high called Jebel Lafol which
is composed of granite with several fair sized trees growing on it.
It lies about 50 miles south-east by east from Mongalla.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Houses.</span>The hill is artificially
terraced with granite slabs throughout and on these terraces,
practically right up to the top of the hill, are built the tukls of
the people, exactly similar to Bari Tukls except that the sides are
made of strips of wood instead of reeds. The fighting men live
round the foot of the hill and the older people higher up.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>There is no water on the
hill itselfâall has to be carried from rain pools of which there
are at this time of year about a dozen round and fairly close to
the hill.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle.</span>All cattle were driven off
during our visit and were only beginning to return when I
leftâthere did not appear to be many really large cattle zeribas,
though these too may have been removed at our approach which had
been watched for by day and night for the last three days.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Chief.</span>Alikori<a id=
"FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> is the chief of the tribe and holds absolute
sway. He is an oldish man of about 65 years of age, about 5 feet 8
inches in height, and like nearly all his tribe, wears a feather
quill piercing his lower lip to allow the saliva to run off, when
smoking, with a minimum of trouble to the smoker.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Succession.</span>The rule of succession
is that brothers succeed each other according to seniority; after
the youngest brotherâs death, the succession passes to the eldest
son of the eldest brother and so on through the family.</p>

<p>Alikori succeeded his father Aseri who had no brothers, the
present heir apparent is named Waller Mari.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Beris.</span>All Beris stated they have
no connection whatever with the Beir tribe opposite Bor<a id=
"FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a> and say they have no other district but Jebel
Lafol. From the top of it one can see 50 miles or more in the Bor
direction; there did not seem to be any roads and no hills were
visible. All tribes in these parts live on hills.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>The cultivation on the
vast plain lying round the hill consists of dura, tobacco, and a
few ground nuts only. The dura was about a foot high and appeared
to be well looked after and the ground cleaned.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>The only trade is the
purchase of dura for sheep, carried on principally with the Lokova
on Mount Illyria and a little with our Bari Sheikhs Lado, Lowala,
etc., on the Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Enemies.</span>The present fashionable
enemy is the Latuka tribe belonging to Queen Topeinârelations with
other powers are reported as satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population.</span>The population probably
amounts to about 3,000 men all told.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Health.</span>People seem very healthy,
quite the opposite of the Baris; no disgusting sights like one sees
in their villages; malformed children are destroyed at birth.
Sleeping sickness is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Legal.</span>All disciplinary powers are
vested in the chief. For premeditated murder punishment is death.
For killing in quarrel, etc., the offender must pay a boy to the
family of the deceased. Thefts of cattle must be repaid or the
offender is exiled. Thefts of food are not looked upon as offences
but as occasional necessities. For adultery the co-respondent must
pay 1 cow, 5 sheep and 5 iron malotes (hoes); the wife is dealt
with by her husband in the seclusion of the home, but must not be
killed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Customs.</span>The birth of a child does
not give an excuse for a festival of any sort.</p>

<p>Marriages are arranged when the girls are very young. The
bridegroom interviews his proposed father-in-law, as in other
countries, and arranges to pay so many sheep a year until the lady
reaches a marriageable age. The ceremony is then celebrated amid
much merissa drinking. Divorce is allowed to husbands only; if
granted they receive back their marriage settlement. A widow
marries her deceased husbandâs brother; if she has no
brother-in-law she may marry someone else, but she usually becomes
the property of the head chief.</p>

<p>Death is believed to be the end of all things. No after state is
believed in. A sheep is always killed over a dead manâs grave.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Language.</span>The language is peculiar
to the tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Clothing.</span>The men go naked or wear a short mantle
of skin over the shoulders. Women wear a broad skin covering from
the waist in front and behind.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arms.</span>The same practically as the
Baris.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Visitors.</span>Alikori states no white
man has ever been to him before (April, 1904). Emin Pasha once
passed with a concourse of people going towards Bor but did not
stop.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Siege.</span>Arabi Dafaalla besieged the
hill for 13 days in 1897; he then drew off having suffered
considerable loss. The natives used to rush the water holes every
night at a different point and thus bring in enough to last for the
next day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>Flour and sheep could
only be obtained on payment by repeatedly demanding them and were
then only forthcoming in very small quantities. It is probable that
when the Beri are again visited supplies of grain and meat will be
more readily produced.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport.</span>Mules, donkeys, and in
the dry season camels could all be advantageously employed for
transport.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>Giraffe, hartebeest, topÃ© and
oribi practically comprised all the game seen, but there were many
fresh tracks of elephant and rhino. One herd of giraffe numbered
over eighty animals.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Road.</span>The best route from Mongalla
to J. Lafol is up the right bank of the branch of the Bahr El
Jebel, south of Mongalla to Sheikh Ladoâs or Lowalaâs (9 miles,
thence south-east up the Felluru river <em>viÃ¢</em> Nierchuk to
junction (18 miles) of track from Ali Bey and Gondokoro, water in
dry season all along this river. Thence general direction east,
passing two pools, liable to be nearly dry in dry season, to Khor
Wandida (15 miles), dry in April. Thence still east to Wallada
lake, 12 miles, thence 11 miles north-east to J. Lafol, passing a
marsh half-way where water should be always obtainable. Total
distance about 65 miles. Between the Felluru River and J. Lafol
there is no track.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c06s2f"></a>(f) <em>Country South of the
Akobo.</em><a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boma.</span>South of the junction of the
Ajibur and Akobo rivers, an undulating tract of country is
traversed before the foot of the Boma hills is reached. The soil is
generally of a gravelly nature, but the district is often most
charmingly wooded, whilst striking cocked-hat shaped peaks to the
west enclose the valley of the Ajibur and add variety to the scene.
Until the Boma hills are entered the country appears to be quite
uninhabited, for it was not until we reached the lower slopes that
we observed natives for the first time gathering the fruit of the
many palms that grow, as well as bamboo, hereabouts. The hilly
district of Boma<a id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104"
class="fnanchor">[104]</a> is then entered, and many streams,
valleys, and ridges have to be crossed. The soil is seemingly very
fertile and capable of producing all kinds of cereals. Proceeding
as we did in a south-westerly direction through these hills, we, of
course, only traversed quite a small corner, so to speak, of the
country, but were much impressed by the possibilities of the place
as the site of a future post along the frontier. The natives
appeared quite friendly; the scenery at times was really grand; and
plenty of food and water could doubtless be always procurable once
the natives saw that they would be protected from outside raiding
parties. The average altitude of this region is generally from
3,000 to 4,000 feet above the sea level, but other ridges and
heights attain an altitude of close on 6,000 feet. The natives were
exceedingly shy, but eventually we persuaded them to approach us,
though unfortunately we were unable to converse with them except by
that most unsatisfactory of meansâsigns. Physically, the menâwe saw
no women at all at close quartersâare finely built and appear a
higher type than the Nuers or Anuaks. Many of them wore ostrich
feathers in their head-dress, and several had large circular
knivesâlike those of the Turkana, but much broaderâround their
wrists. Beads were very generally worn, and many of the young
bloods had broad bands of red beads, picked out with patches of
blue and white ones, fastened across the forehead. Small skin
aprons, not unlike those of the Turkana, were also worn by some of
the men. Most of the menâs spears were sheathed and not carried
like those of the Nuers and Anuaks uncovered. The huts we saw were
wretched little grass erections with no appearance of stability,
and gave one the impression of being little more than mere rough
shelters. We gathered from these natives that they had recently
been raided by the Magois, whom they hate and fear, and had in
consequence no goats or sheep left. We certainly did not see any,
but at the same time the men looked so sturdy and well-filled that
they probably had plenty of grain food. Moreover, the wild fig
grows fairly abundantly along the banks of some of the streams. The
loftier heights of the country are well wooded, and though,
perhaps, they were somewhat distant to judge accurately, I think
probably these trees would provide excellent timber for building
purposes. The climate appeared most bracing, and, judging by the
few days experience we had, the rainfall must be very heavy.</p>

<p>Grand solid rock peaks in places spring out from the ridges in a
curious manner, and by their precipitous appearance would probably
tax the resource of the most skilled Alpine climbers to reach their
summits. We were able to learn nothing regarding the customs or
habits of these natives, and, in fact, from the time we left Anuak
country until we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
reached the Uganda Protectorate had to carry out all conversation
by signs. Judging by the great display of beads made, for trading
purposes I have little doubt but that red, blue and white beads
would be readily taken in exchange for food. The small bead known
as âpoundâ beads would, I think, be far less popular than a
slightly larger variety about the size of a pea. The beads should
be opaque, and the ordinary glass beads procurable in Cairo, I
fancy, would be little sought after.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Karuno.</span>To the south of Boma and
some short distance away from the foot of the hills, a pleasantly
wooded tract of country is traversed, consisting of alternate
plains of open bush and grass land, whilst water is obtained from
khors running in a westerly direction across this plain, before
turning north. Further south, again, however, a most uninviting
dried up plain, which, after rains, would probably be converted
into heavy bog, is met with, and water now becomes a most-serious
consideration as far as about lat. 5Â° 30â² north, where a broad
sandy-bedded khor winds its way across the plain in a westerly
direction. Along this river bed we found the Karuno tribe settled
in considerable numbers. They appeared to be a somewhat powerful
tribe, and were certainly the most elaborately bedecked and
prosperous looking set of men we saw during our journey. They
possessed large numbers of cattle, goats and sheep, and donkeys,
and also grow grain along the banks of the Karuno. Like all the
natives of these regions, they are extremely suspicious of
strangers, and though not unfriendly, are by no means anxious, it
seemed to us, to have anything to do with Europeans. I do not
remember these people having ever before been mentioned by any
traveller; but on comparing my map with Mr. Donaldson Smithâs we
seemed most obviously to be at the place shown by him as inhabited
by the Magois tribe. On enquiring of these natives where the Magois
were, they pointed away across the plain to the west, and gave us
to understand they had been driven away in that direction by the
Turkana, who had come up in force from the south. Although we tried
to induce the Karuno people to bring grain or goats and sheep into
camp for sale, they would not do so, nor would they even provide us
with guides. This is probably more due to the fear these natives
entertain of travelling into their neighbourâs country than from
any unfriendly motives. Here, where raids and counter-raids are
frequently being indulged in, considerable hostility naturally
exists between the several tribes living next each other. The
Karuno in some respects are not unlike the Turkana, except that
their head-dress is not a long pendant bag-shaped one, but more
like a squat chignon, which is stuck full of fine vari-coloured
ostrich feathers. Beads are worn by them in great quantities,
chiefly red, white, and a variegated one known in East Africa as
âPunda maliaâ (zebra). Many of the young warriors in addition to
numerous strings round the neck, had solid bands of beadsâsimilar
to those we saw in Bomaâfastened across the forehead. The elders
have most handsome head-dresses made of cowrie shells, whilst
others again wore skull caps made of small white and red beads
worked into a neat design of many circles. Physically, the men are
well set up and sturdy, though they do not run to height much and
are probably little above the average stature.</p>

<p>The women are not unlike the Turkana, and weave their hair into
straight ringlets which fall round the head. They also wear beads
in great numbers round the neck, whilst the lower part of the body
is covered with a skin apron, cut away at the side with a flap in
front and a long trailing tail arrangement behind.</p>

<p>In addition to long handled spears, the men carry short stabbing
spears, and oblong-shaped hide shields.</p>

<p>Exactly what extent of country the Karuno occupy I can hardly
say, but I should imagine they do not exist further east than the
foot of the escarpment, where the country becomes thickly wooded
with thorn bush. In a westerly direction they probably do not
extend more than 2 or 3 miles beyond where we first struck the
Karuno river bed, leaving an uninhabited area of country between
themselves and the Magois. After leaving the Karuno, and striking
at first in a south-easterly, and later in an easterly direction,
we reached and travelled along the foot of a rocky escarpment
through an irregular bay, as it were, in the hills. The valley,
between our line of march and broken hills to the south, was
thickly wooded with thorn bush, and water was difficult to find. We
saw a few old grass huts of natives, which had been deserted for
some months previously, but saw no signs of human life. It is
probable that this tract of country can only be occupied during the
rainy season of the year, owing to the extreme scarcity of
water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Musha.</span>After we had worked our way
through these hills, finally crossing the eastern ridge by an easy
pass, we found ourselves in a broad plain, thickly covered with
thorn bush. Some 30 miles east more hills seemed to bar progress in
that direction, whilst to the south the thorny plain appeared to
extend for some 40 miles to the foot of the high mountain masses to
the west of Lake Rudolf. We were now in the tract of country called
by Dr. Donaldson Smith, Musha. The thorn-bush plain terminated to
the north at the foot of two lofty mountains, the more westerly one
of which attains a height of close on 6,000 feet, whilst the
loftier mass to the south-east of it (previously known to me as
<span class="sidenote">Mount Naita.</span>Mount Naita, and called
by Dr. Donaldson Smith, Etua; whilst in BottÃ©goâs map it is named
Aguzzo) reaches a height of about 7,300 feet. We passed numerous
kraals whilst journeying in an easterly direction across this
plain, which had all been temporarily abandoned by the natives,
with whom we could get no intercourse, as they refused to approach
us. On several occasions, when we saw two or three natives watching
us from a distance, men were sent out to try and induce them to
come into camp, but they fled before our men could get within even
shouting distance of them. We were most anxious to obtain the
service of guides, as the country before us was unknown, and the
anxieties regarding water had become very great. It would appear,
judging by the tracks we saw, that the Musha<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_150">[150]</span> possess much livestock, consisting of
camels, cattle, donkeys, goats, and sheep. In the thick bush,
however, these people had little difficulty in driving them away
and concealing their animals until we had passed, when presumably
they returned again to their kraals. On one occasion, however, our
advent was unexpected, as near our camping ground some of our party
surprised two or three Musha, who were tending a flock of over 200
goats and sheep, and perhaps a dozen donkeys. The natives fled,
leaving everything behind in their little enclosures. Strict orders
were issued that these animals were not to be touched, as we hoped
by so doing we might induce the natives to understand that we were
not a marauding expedition, and were desirous of opening friendly
intercourse with them. The animals were left alone all that day and
night, but the Musha evidently feared to return, and when we
marched off next morning the donkeys gave us a parting bray, which
was the nearest approach to friendly intercourse we experienced in
this neighbourhood, as we never saw another Musha man during the
rest of our journey. In due course we crossed another low range of
hills to the south of that grand mountain, Naita, and entered
another wooded valley, which ultimately joined that of the River
Sacchi, where we arrived on the 1st April, and our difficulties
regarding water for the present<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_151">[151]</span> were at an end. I would here remark that
perhaps for nine months in the year, for a large party to cross
this bit of country from Boma to the Sacchi, by the route followed
by us, would be a most risky undertaking owing to the extreme
scarcity of water. The many watercourses shown on the map were
found to be almost without exception merely dry stony beds in which
no water was procurable by digging. Fortunately, about the 20th
March, rain had fallen to the east of where we then were, and by
extraordinary good luck we subsequently found pools at intervals,
after long continued search. One point worthy of note is that, in
spite of previous rain, we seldom found water in the actual nullah
beds, as, owing to their stony nature, the water runs off at once.
What water was found was nearly always in depressions some distance
away from the banks of these nullahs, where the clayey soil
prevented percolation, and retained water in pools until it became
evaporated in due course by the hot sun.</p>

<p>On our previous visit to Lake Rudolf from the south, our old Suk
guide, Nyanga by name, had on several occasions pointed out to me
the striking Naita peak away to the north-west, and told me that
the country thereabouts was the most dreadful one he knew for
scarcity of water. I believed him, as he was about the most
knowledgable and intelligent native of his class regarding the
geography of the country that I have ever met. His information had
now been verified by us, and it was with a sigh of relief we found
the <span class="sidenote">Sacchi river.</span>Sacchi a running
stream. To the Swahilis the tract of country we had traversed was
always known as Donyiro, which name appears on the map prepared by
the Macdonald expedition.</p>

<p>From very imperfect data I am inclined to think that between our
southerly route from Boma and the valley of the Sacchi the
escarpment we skirted is the edge of a fine hilly plateau,<a id=
"FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a> varying in height probably from 3,000 to 5,000
feet above sea level. I imagine all that tract of country to be a
fertile and probably well-watered region, very much like Boma
itself. Whether it is thickly populated it is difficult to say, as
the country is absolutely unknown to Europeans, but to traverse it
from north to south and east to west with mule transport would
probably be most interesting. It would probably be almost too
difficult for any pack animals except mules and perhaps donkeys.
The much talked of gold, which is discussed by our Swahilis as
existing in those parts, might also be found, although I must admit
we never saw any gold ornaments worn by natives in the plains
bordering that country.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c06s2g"></a>(g) <em>The Upper Pibor.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>In August, 1904, the head
waters of the so-called Pibor were explored by Lieutenant D. C.
Comyn, Black Watch. It was found that 17 miles above the Akobo
junction the river bifurcated, one branch known as the Agwei<a id=
"FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a> apparently coming from the E. and S.E., the
other, known by the Anuaks as Nyanabek, by the Nuers as Kang, and
by the Agibbas as Natila, from the S. and S.W.</p>

<p>Following the latter branch, without encountering any serious
sudd obstructions, Lieutenant Comyn succeeded, with the aid of a
steam launch, in reaching a point which appeared to him to be very
near the source of this important feeder of the Pibor.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Source.</span>The flooded plain in which
the river seemingly has its origin, is according to Lieutenant
Comynâs sketch, about 60 miles due E. of Bor, and 170 miles by
river above the Akobo junction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Banks.</span>The banks of the Natila are
as a rule ill-defined, swampy and sudd-fringed; in places they
appear to be as much as 200 to 250 yards apart.</p>

<p>Almost throughout its course the banks were more or less
inundated, the left bank being usually the higher, and in its upper
reaches the plain was flooded to a depth of a foot or more for many
miles round.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water-way.</span>The water-way varied
from 20 to 70 yards in width, and about 20 miles above the Akobo
junction, what appeared to be a sudd-covered lake, some 800 yards
broad and 6 miles in length, was traversed by a deep and tortuous
channel 20 to 30 yards wide.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Depth.</span>The average depth for the
first 130 miles was found to be about 20 feet, but in the next 40
miles the river gradually shoaled to about 15 inches, and the
direction of its course was then only faintly distinguishable by
the band of light-green grass which blocked its bed and precluded
further progress.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Current.</span>The current varied from Â¾
to 2 miles per hour, the rise and fall of the river apparently
depending largely on the local rainfall. In the dry season the
plain, and, according to the Agibbas, the river itself dries
up.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fuel.</span>Fuel is plentiful everywhere,
the river being fringed with a belt of talh and heglig trees for
the greater part of its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span><span class=
"sidenote">J. Atin.</span>J. Atin, standing on the left bank, about
1Â½ miles from the river and about 100 miles from the Akobo
junction, forms a conspicuous landmark. It is a solid rocky mass
about 2 miles in circumference, and has twin peaks some 400 feet
above the plain.</p>

<p>Gordon is said to have marched up the right bank in 1878 (?) and
to have crossed to J. Atin, and to have marched thence westwards to
the Nile through the Beir or Beri country.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>As is stated on
<a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a> the inhabitants of the Lower Pibor
are Nuers and a few of the less powerful Anuaks. On the Upper Pibor
or Natila a tribe known as the Agibba were found, their first
village being Nyanabek, about 70 miles S. of the Akobo. For the
next 60 miles villages were frequently seen.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Agibba tribe.</span>Lieutenant Comyn
gives the following account of the Agibba tribe, who appear to
strongly resemble the Nuers, and also in some respects the
Turkana:â</p>

<p>âThe Agibbas are a warlike tribe, feared by and fearing the
Nuers. Their other neighbours, the Anuaks and Dinkas, they look on
with contempt, and buy their suksuk from them. The Abyssinians do
not harry this part of the tribe. A few men know the Nuer, Dinka
and Anuak dialect. Their physique is good, but their stature is not
uniform. Many seem to suffer from hydrocele, and I saw one man with
elephantiasis in the leg. They are armed with roughly-made spears
of various shapes, wrist knives, and an oblong shield of giraffe
hide, and invariably carry their head-rest to sit upon. Their huts
are rudely built, of a bee-hive shape, and about the same size as
an ordinary tukl.â</p>

<p>âThey appear to have no canoes, and I saw no fishing-spears,
though plenty of fish baskets. Their ivory ornaments are old and
small. The principal men wear over the right elbow a bunch of
giraffe tails, the band ornamented with cowrie shells. Their
clothing consists of a belt round the waist, and, in front and
behind (if a man is well off), a skin often embroidered and edged
with beadsâmost wear a 3Â½-inch band of red beads with a 1-inch line
down the centre across their foreheads. Some of the older men had a
bead-covered bowl on their heads instead. The hair of the younger
men was dressed very neatly, like an inverted soup plate with the
part over the forehead cut oft. They have all sorts of suksuk. What
they asked for were (in order of preference) cowrie shells, beads
(janitor), brass wire, red, white and other beads. The head sheikh,
whose name I think is Nadgweir (they were very averse to telling
it) seems a man of character. All seem afraid of him, and said if
they took up spears without his permission he would cut their
throats. I saw but half-a-dozen of women and no children.â</p>

<p class="sch">THE BAHR EL GHAZAL.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s01"></a>1. <em>Introductory.</em></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Introduction.</span>The Bahr El Ghazal
was re-occupied by the troops of the Sudan Government during the
winter of 1900-1901. Before their advent the most recent detailed
descriptions of the country (not counting the necessarily
superficial writings of the Marchand Expedition in 1898) date from
pre-Dervish days (<em>e.g.</em>, Junker, Schweinfurth, etc.).
Although there has not been time or opportunity for the whole of
the country to be subjected to a searching examination since 1901,
still, sufficient is known to prove that great changes have taken
place in the province since 1881. Roads and places have
disappeared, the face of the country has in many parts completely
changed, and tribes have disappeared, have been thinned out, or
have emigrated to other territories.</p>

<p>Thus it will be found that in many particulars the detail given
in the following pages will not at all bear out the descriptions by
Schweinfurth and Junker of 20 years or more ago.</p>

<p>(For an abstract of the descriptions by these celebrated
travellers, <em>vide</em> H.B.S. pp. 110-138.)</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s02"></a>2. <em>General Description.</em></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boundaries.</span>The Bahr El Ghazal
province is bounded on the south and west by the Congo-Nile
watershed, on the north by the Bahr El Arab and Bahr El Ghazal, and
on the east by the Bahr El Jebel. Its previous history and that of
the occupation of this province in 1900-01 by the Sudan Government
is narrated elsewhere (<em>vide</em> Part II, Chaps. <a href=
"#p2c05">V</a> and <a href="#p2c07">VII</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The various areas.</span>The northern
boundary of the ferruginous tableland through which the western
tributaries of the Nile pass from the watershed through the Bahr El
Ghazal country may roughly be said to coincide with a line drawn
through Rumbek and Chamamui (Chak Chak). North of this and until
the sudd is reached, the country is flat, and the soil is clay,
with great plains of long grass and many swamps interveningââThe
Steppesâ of Schweinfurth. North-west of this the country is dry and
covered with bush, cut up by small khors, which are full in the
rainy season. The sudd extends from Lake No to Meshra El Rek (where
a base post has been established), and stretches westwards towards
Chamamui, to receive the contents of the Wau, Bongo, and Bahr El
Arab rivers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The table-land.</span>The tableland rises
gradually towards the south and west to the watershed, the
undulations of the surface becoming more pronounced in this
direction, and the khors more defined and frequent. Granitic
outcrops, rising to 400 feet in some cases, are numerous along the
higher slopes of the watershed. Everywhere ironstone and
crystalline rock appear above the thin layer of soil that covers
them. Nevertheless, on the lower slopes and in the basins of the
various khors the soil is profitable and fertile, generally of a
rich copper colour with a certain amount of sandstone soil. In
Telgona district and the country round, especially to the north and
west, are several granitic outcrops, the seven-peaked Telgona and
the conical hill of Lutu being the most remarkable. Great forests
cover the country almost throughout from east to west. In the
steppes of the lower level there are many grass plains, which
become vast swamps in the rains. In the table-land the open plains
are of no great area.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Soil and geological formation.</span>The
soil, both in the swamps and in the land liable to annual
inundation, is a rich black clayey loam. In the portions further
away from the rivers there is often a large mixture of sand washed
down from the higher lands. Most of it is, however, very suitable
for cultivation. Alluvial plains border one or both banks of all
the more important rivers for a considerable distance up their
courses. It is only in the upper reaches that the alluvial deposits
almost disappear and that the rocky tree-clad slopes descend
abruptly to the river. The soil on the higher lands is usually
sandy, and clayey in depressions or near streams. It overlies a
pitted, ferruginous stone or laterite, which, in its turn, rests on
granite, which in places degenerates into gneiss, schists, or
quartzite. These granitic rocks are, as a rule, not visible in the
lower portion of the highlands, which only show abundance of
ironstone, but further inland outcrops of granite become more
frequent, and the country becomes more undulating, forming long,
low hill ranges, or throwing up solitary granitic hills, usually
rounded in outline, but occasionally more rugged in appearance.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span><a id=
"p1c07s03"></a>3. <em>Rivers and Water Supply.</em></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rivers.</span>The surface of the Bahr El
Ghazal country is intersected by many rivers threading their way
from the watershed towards the Nile. Passing through the lower
plateaux of the tableland, they are mostly fine broad rivers, with
high banks and sandy bottoms, and are generally similar in
formation. The Boro, Sopo, Chel, Sueh or Jur, and Rodi vary from 80
to 130 yards in breadth, and should be navigable for small craft,
when in flood, for considerable distances. The current in flood is
not more than 2 knots per hour. The Jur River is navigable for
steamers from its mouth as far as the âPoste des Rapidesâ at
Rafili, and probably above this point by light draught steamers to
Khojali, from August till November. In the tableland and higher
plateaux of the watershed, these rivers are fed by many streams
running down from the slopes and hills. On the other hand, in the
lower steppes to the north, the water runs up into many khors and
swamps, which break away from the banks. Lower down, the banks
disappear altogether, and the waters are discharged into the
sudd.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage of the country.</span>The
western portion of the Bahr El Ghazal is drained, at least in its
more elevated portions, by several rivers running in a more or less
northerly direction. These are, beginning from the east: The Rohl
(Naam) River, the Jau, the Tonj River, the Jur River, with its more
important branch the Wau River, the Bongo River, and the Chel
River, which, not far from Deim Zubeir, unites two branches, the
Kuru and the Biri Rivers. There are also less important rivers,
such as the Mulmul and the Getti, which do not flow during the dry
weather. The most important of all, on account of its volume of
water, is the River Jur or Sueh, which, flowing from Temburaâs
country past Wau, joins the Bahr El Ghazal some 20 miles below
Meshra el Rek. The courses of the other rivers, whether ultimately
falling into the Bahr El Ghazal itself, or first joining the Bahr
Telgona or Bahr El Arab, have not yet been properly explored, and
the exploration is rendered difficult by the fact that, owing to
the flatness of the country in their lower courses, the water
spreads all over the land and forms enormous swamps which stretch
to those which join the Bahr El Ghazal itself. The Jur itself,
powerful a stream as it is, does not break the rule, and the
parties occupied in cutting its sudd had great difficulty in
tracing the channel when crossing the swamps. According to its
drainage, then, the country can be divided into three zones, viz.,
(<em>a</em>) the perennial swamps near the mouths of the rivers,
(<em>b</em>) the somewhat raised alluvial flats further up, which
are liable to inundation during the rains, and (<em>c</em>) the
undulating plateaux or hilly country in the upper reaches.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>In the dry season
water is scarce in the plains and plateaux. It is generally
obtained from shallow pits and wells, seldom more than 20 feet
below the surface, though it cannot always be found at that
level.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s04"></a>4. <em>Administration.</em></h3>

<p>The Bahr El Ghazal now forms a Province under a Mudir or
Governor (and Commandant) assisted by three or four British
officers and inspectors. The headquarters are at Wau.</p>

<p>At present a line of Government posts has been established from
east to west as follows:âShambe on the Nile, Rumbek, Tonj, Wau (the
headquarters), Chamamui (Chak Chak), Deim Zubeir and Telgona. A
post has also recently been established at Kossinga and another at
Kafi Kingi to the north-west of the province. Each of these posts
consists of a small garrison, a few huts, and store-houses.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes the Province is divided into three
DistrictsââEastern,â Headquarters at Rumbek; âCentral,â
Headquarters at Wau; and âWestern,â Headquarters at Deim
Zubeir.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s05"></a>5. <em>Resources.</em></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ivory.</span>The resources of the country
are yet to be developed.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of ivory, and elephants are still very
numerous in many parts, especially towards the north, where they
feed on the gum tree. The natives hunt them, but do not apparently
reduce the numbers to any extent.</p>

<p>Ivory now forms one of the chief products of the Province.</p>

<p>The following information regarding the forests of the Bahr El
Ghazal is taken from a report by Mr. A. F. Broun, Director of
Forests to the Sudan Government.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">India-rubber.</span>As regards the
india-rubber, the rubber-yielding species is found to be a fairly
large apocynaceous creeper, a <i>landolphia</i>, called âOdiloâ by
the Jurs, and âNdalaâ by the Golos and Dinkas. Of three other
similar plants, one is an apocynaceous climber (also a
<i>landolphia</i>) called âApwamahâ by the Jurs and Dinkas and âBiâ
by the Golos, nearly allied to the first; another is a large
(originally <em>epiphytic</em>) ficus, known as âKwelâ; while the
third, known generally by its Arabic name âLulu,â is a bassia
(<i>Parkii</i>), and the only one which belongs to the natural
order, the <em>sapotaceÃ¦</em>, which yields the best
gutta-percha.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">âOdiloâ or âNdala.â</span>âOdiloâ or
âNdalaâ (<i>landolphia owariensis</i>) is found almost entirely on
the ironstone, and only in very rocky<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> situations, such as the edges of the
ironstone plateau. In such places, although by no means rare, it is
by no means so well represented as its cousin the âApwamaâ (or
âBiâ), from which it can be recognised by its young and slightly
hairy shoots, and by its fruit, which is smaller and with a sweet
pulp, while that of the âApwamaâ is acidulated. It is also a
smaller climber than the latter. There is, apparently, no âOdiloâ
on the route from Wau to Deim Zubeir <em>viÃ¢</em> Chak Chak, nor
between the Bongo and the Chel near Deim Zubeir, but in the old
days it used to be obtained in abundance from places far or near,
and was purchased by Government. It is, in fact, fairly well
distributed all over the Province.</p>

<p>The usual native method of collecting is as follows:â</p>

<p>A tangential slice is taken out of the bark, no special care
being taken not to reach the wood, and, as the milk oozes out of
the various milk vessels which have been cut through, it is taken
up by the finger and spread out on the collectorâs bare skin,
either on the arm or over the stomach. It dries very quickly and is
collected into a ball by being rolled with the hand, or into a
spindle-shaped mass round a piece of twig. The rapidity with which
the milk coagulates is very striking, for, five minutes after the
cut is made, all that has been collected is made up into a ball and
is ready for the market. This peculiarity, although in many ways it
shows the excellence of the rubber, renders the clean collection a
matter of great difficulty, for the wounds get covered by a film
very quickly, and collection in vessels seems to be almost
impossible. During the rainy season the outflow of milk is more
copious.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">âApwamaâ or âBi.â</span>The other
<i>landolphia (florida)</i>, âApwamaâ or âBi,â grows under similar
conditions as âOdilo.â It is however, more abundant, and grows to a
larger size. It is a gigantic climber which reaches the crowns of
the tallest trees. Its milky juice is much more copious than that
of its cousin, but, on the other hand, it coagulates with much more
difficulty. The difficulty with the collection of this latex is to
obtain it pure. The bark of the creeper is coarse, and as the stems
are not upright but bent in all directions, it is difficult to hang
collecting bottles in such a way as to make a clean collection. The
indiarubber obtained from the âApwamaâ is far inferior to that
which the âOdiloâ produces, and has but little elasticity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">âKwel.â</span>The âKwelâ (<i>Ficus
platyphylla</i>) is a large fig-tree which is found all over the
province, but is most abundant in the lowlands, especially between
Wau and Meshra El Rek. In appearance it is a good deal like the
âBanyanâ (<i>Ficus bengalensis</i>). Like the âBanyan,â it usually
germinates on another tree, generally in a place where moisture is
retained for some time, such as the fork of the stem, the axil of a
palm leaf, etc. After some time it begins sending down roots,
which, following the stem, ultimately reach the ground. Once this
is effected the young tree grows apace, sends down fresh roots,
which ultimately surround the stem of the host and finally kill it.
Many such figs germinate in the axils of dead leaves on the
âDeleibâ which they finally fold in their embrace. The palms, being
endogenous, are hard to kill, hence the not uncommon spectacle of a
âDeleibâ growing out of a tree. Many âKwelâ trees in the Dinka
districts have become mutilated by badly done tapping. This latex,
when dry, forms a resinous brittle gum, apparently of little value,
as it is used by the natives to clean brass ornaments. When the
tree is tapped the latex flows in abundance, pulsating somewhat
like blood from a cut artery.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">âLulu.â</span>The âLuluâ
(<i>Butyrospermum Parkii</i>) belongs to the family of
<em>SapotaceÃ¦</em>. It is common all over the ironstone country,
and grows abundantly on the borders of the alluvial flats and the
plateaux, especially between the Tonj and Naam rivers. The fruit of
the âLulu,â called the âSudan date,â forms a staple food. Edible
oil, greatly used in cooking, is extracted from the kernel, which
resembles the horse chestnut.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tanning products.</span>The forests of
the Bahr El Ghazal will probably some day be of great value on
account of the number of trees which yield tannin. The two great
families from which tannin is obtained, viz., <em>CombretaceÃ¦</em>
and <em>MimosÃ¦</em>, are abundantly represented, and some trees
have already a reputation for their richness in tannin, viz., âAbu
Surugâ (<i>Prosopis oblonga</i>) and âMudusâ (<i>Parkia
filicoidea</i>), the bark of which fetches a good price at
Omdurman.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Timber.</span>With some notable
exceptions, the forests have suffered from fire; the trees are
stunted, crooked, hollow, or generally misshapen, and
fire-protection will be required to obtain better grown timber.
There are, however, a few gigantic trees which have risen above the
fires and would yield timber of large dimensions. The most common
is perhaps <i>Khaya Senegalensis</i> (âHomraâ Arabic name), a tree
of the family of the <em>MeliaceÃ¦</em>, to which mahogany and satin
wood belong, and which generally gives handsome or useful timber.
The bark is, not unlikely, a febrifuge, and the seed yields an oil
which keeps away flies, etc., from wounds; it is used against the
âserutâ flies. There are also two enormous trees of the family of
the <em>LeguminosÃ¦</em>, viz., the âMudusâ (mentioned above), which
is found abundantly near Tonj and sporadically to Wau, and the
âShandeâ (Jur name) (<i>Daniellia Thurifera</i>) which grows on the
banks of the Wau River, not far from old Wau. There are several
others of varying dimensions and also Bamboos, but these are not in
sufficient quantities to be considered as an article of export.
âRattanâ is also found near Tembura.</p>

<a href="#Page_157">p. 157.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wax and honey.</span>Bees are abundant in
the Bahr El Ghazal, and large quantities of honey are collected
every year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Salt.</span>Salt is found only in the
west, in the Faroge district, but is in demand everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Crops.</span>Generally speaking, the ground is cleared
in April. Crops are sown in May, and reaped in November-December.
One crop a year.</p>

<p>Indian corn is grown extensively in the plateaux. Sown in April,
it ripens in August. Sorghum dura is grown universally. The Dinkas,
living near the marshes, sow this at the end of March, it ripens in
October, and has a short stalk 4 feet high. Everywhere else it
grows 12 feet high and ripens in December. Ground nuts and pumpkins
are also universally grown, especially by the Dinkas. Simsim,
telabun, dukhn, and various vegetables are met with in the
habitations of other tribes. Locusts play great havoc with the
crops, and the natives, especially the Dinkas, are too lazy to
combat them. The crops are increasing in extent, especially in the
western portion; each military post cultivates a certain amount,
but it is expected that the natives will soon produce enough (bar
accidents and drought) to supply the troops and any demand that may
be made on them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Minerals.</span>Iron is very plentiful
almost throughout the province, and is extensively worked
(<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_160">p. 160</a>). A recent analysis
of the iron ore gives a percentage of 47 per cent. of pure
iron.</p>

<p>Copper is only found at the rich mines of Hofrat El Nahas, near
the southern borders of Darfur. It lies in the midst of a deserted
country, and has not been worked for a long time. It had not been
visited by Europeans (until Colonel Sparkesâs recent journey,
February, 1903), since 1876 (Purdy).<a id=
"FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> According to recent analysis of a specimen the
ore is a silicate and carbonate, not a sulphate, of copper,
containing 14 per cent. of pure metal. Although there is an immense
quantity of this ore, its distance from civilisation and the
obstacles to transport will render its development a matter of
considerable difficulty for some time to come. In places, it sticks
up in ridges above the surface.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Currency.</span>Different tribes and
districts have a fancy for various articles of barter. âGenotorâ
(Gianotta) beads (round, black beads with white and coloured spots)
are useful anywhere. With the Dinkas, small white and red beads
(âSuk-sukâ) and brass wire, especially in the form of bracelets,
are acceptable; but cloth only holds a steady demand on the direct
routes to Government posts, where the inhabitants are thrown into
contact with civilisation; it is, however, rapidly becoming more
popular, and in some parts of the country is preferred to beads.
Jurs like beads, brass and cloth. Golos and Bongos prefer cloth,
which also obtains the best value from the Nyam Nyams. The Dinkas
in the north have been in the habit of exchanging ivory for cattle
with the Baggara Arabs.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s06"></a>6. <em>Climate and Hygiene.</em></h3>

<p>The rainy season<a id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a> begins in April and ends in November;
December, January, February, and March are the dry months, when the
humidity is slight, though there is always a certain amount of dew.
From the end of April till the middle of November rain falls, on
the average, one day out of three, generally in very heavy showers
lasting for two or three hours at a time. In the early months
terrific thunderstorms accompany the showers. The shade temperature
in the dry season shows an average maximum of 98Â° and a minimum of
59Â°. In the rainy season the maximum in April, May, and June
averages 89Â°, and from July to December 85Â°. The minimum average
during these months is 70Â°. During the rains the humidity is
excessive, and the dews exceedingly heavy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sickness. Malaria.</span>About 80 per
cent. of the sickness in the Bahr El Ghazal is due to malaria. It
attacks Europeans and Egyptians more severely than blacks.</p>

<p>The frequency and severity of this disease varies with the
season and also with the locality. June and July have proved the
most unhealthy months; the rainy season being then at its height.
From December to March there is very little sickness. The natives
state that some years are far more unhealthy than others, but this
does not seem to depend upon the amount of rainfall. The most
unhealthy stations are Wau, Meshra El Rek, and Tonj, all of which
are built close to the river banks, whilst Rumbek and Deim Zubeir,
which are some miles from a river, and watered from wells, are
comparatively healthy. It is a noticeable fact that the natives
never build villages near the river bank, but generally at least a
mile inland; they also usually drink from wells. This is probably
done to avoid mosquitoes, and therefore is a possible reason for
the small amount of fever amongst them. Mosquitos cannot breed in
shallow wells from which all the water is drawn several times
daily. By selecting these positions for their villages they are
also removed from the marsh, which is usually found on one or other
bank of the river. Egyptians are more susceptible than Europeans,
and the Sudanese from Khartoum more so than natives.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Varieties of fever.</span>Although the
ordinary periodic types of fever are met with, and easily combated
by quinine, a malignant type is far from uncommon, and is a very
serious trouble. The patient may have two or three distinct attacks
of fever in one day, and often on two or three consecutive days,
leaving him weak and unfit for duty. Vomiting is a common
accompaniment, and sometimes continues for two days. The stomach
refuses food or medicine, and quinine has to be injected
subcutaneously. Drugs, however, seem to have little effect on the
course of the fever. The after effects<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_157">[157]</span> met with are anÃ¦mia, rheumatism, neuralgia,
and dyspepsia. The most serious complication, however, is
âblackwater fever,â which is a hÃ¦moglobinuria, occurring in a
patient saturated with malaria. The red-blood corpuscles are
destroyed by the action of the malarial parasite, and the
hÃ¦moglobin thus set free is passed in the urine, giving it its
characteristic port wine colour. The patient becomes terribly weak,
has acute pain over the stomach, vomits frequently, and cannot
retain any nourishment, the heart becomes very feeble, and death
only too often follows. At present there have been as far as is
known, since 1900, about eight cases, with only two recoveries; it
does not appear to attack natives at all.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Guinea worm.</span>Guinea worm is common
amongst the natives and Sudanese. It has been met with all over the
country, from Meshra El Rek to the Nyam Nyam country. It appears in
June and July, and is often the cause of ankylosis of the joints.
From observations made in 1901-02 the period of incubation would
appear to be a long oneâprobably 10 or 12 months. At least one
European has developed it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Boils.</span>Boils are common and appear
in epidemic form, chiefly attacking the hands.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dysentery.</span>Dysentery in its true
form has not been met with. The water supply at all stations is
good.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Small-pox.</span>Small-pox occurs
occasionally amongst the natives and carries off hundreds. An
outbreak occurred amongst Temburaâs Nyam Nyams in the winter of
1903-04.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Phthisis.</span>Phthisis in all its forms
is common, and is believed to be responsible for a large percentage
of the mortality amongst natives. September, October and November
are the months in which it is most prevalent.</p>

<p>Night blindness is common.</p>

<p>Beyond mention of the great frequency of hydrocele and hernia
amongst the natives, there is nothing else that calls for special
remark.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mosquitos.</span>Mosquitos are not very
numerous on the dry plateaux of the table-land and the lower
steppes during the dry season, but abound during the rainy season
near the rivers. Near the sudd, and on it, they are always to be
met with, but not in any quantities away from the rivers. At least
two out of six specimens sent home were found to belong to
malaria-bearing species.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tsetse fly. Sleeping sickness.</span>A
species of the tsetse fly, identified as <i>Glossina morsitans</i>,
was discovered in 1903 (April) by Major G. R. Griffith, D.S.O.
Beyond its often fatal attacks on animals, it seems otherwise
harmless. Sleeping sickness is unknown in the Bahr El Ghazal,
though fatal cases have occurred in the Lado enclave, which adjoins
it.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s07"></a>7. <em>Forestry.</em><a id=
"FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class=
"fnanchor">[109]</a></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fires.</span>The Bahr El Ghazal province
is, unfortunately, no exception to the general rule which prevails
in the Sudan. Traces of fires are clear everywhere, from the grass
lands near the rivers to the innermost portions of the uninhabited
forest tracts to the north-east and east of Deim Zubeir. The
largest fires are started in the grass lands near the rivers in
order to provide tender herbage for the cattle. These, as they
sweep inland, are fed by others, which are made to clear the
country near the villages, and they are then carried on until they
rush on and penetrate into the forest themselves. In the forests,
where the paths get overgrown with grass, travellers fire the
grass, not only to clear the way, but to provide against coming
unexpectedly on wild animals. Further, fires are lighted for
hunting purposes. The reed rat, which lives in long grass near
water, and which is generally relished for its meat, is hunted by
setting fire to the grass, and the hunting of other animals,
including the elephant, is accomplished in a similar manner. It is
evident that before such fierce fires seedling growth is killed
out; that saplings and young trees are killed or mutilated, and
that larger trees themselves must suffer, especially on the
outskirts of the forests. So heavy is the toll taken that more wood
is destroyed each year than is produced by the increase in girth
and by the birth of new trees in places respected by the fires once
in a way. In other words, the capital is being eaten into, the
forests are deteriorating, and, unless protected, will ultimately
disappear. Apart from purely economic reasons this is a prospect
which is not good to contemplate if the effect of such a denudation
is considered.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Forest zones.</span>As before mentioned,
the country can be divided into three divisions, according to the
amount of drainage. Each of these divisions has its own
characteristic vegetation:â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Swamp vegetation.</span>The ambach
(<i>Herminiera elaphroxylon</i>), which in places forms dense
covers, and on the upper Bahr El Ghazal almost supplants papyrus,
is the only plant which may claim to form forest vegetation. It may
in future be of use, owing to its lightness, in floating timber
down the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lands not always submerged.</span>On the
land, which is under water annually at flood time, forest
vegetation is scanty, and such trees as there are are usually
perched on the top of termite hills. Such are the <i>Sarcocephalus
esculentus</i> and <i>Mitragyne Africana</i> (<em>Rubiaceae</em>),
the ardeib, dabka, gughan, the small-leaved inderab, and, where the
soil is poor, <i>Euphorbia candelabrum</i>. Large expanses of
country are treeless, owing to fires and heavy felling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Highland forests.</span>On the higher ground the chief
ones are tamarind and gughan, with sidr bushes, talh (acacia), and
talh-beida forests, um shutur, zeitun (edible fruit), abu khamera
and heglig, and occasionally habil.</p>

<p>The above trees are also found on the higher land, but generally
near water or in clay soil and in smaller quantities. The highland
forests, however, differ largely from those on the lower lands,
there being little acacia or thorny growth. Among the largest trees
are the nwana (tanning bark âmudusâ) and abu surug (tanning bark),
kuru, riang or bei, shanda and koba (in best parts of forest),
digdig (sweet yellow flowers), homra (large tree, allied to
mahogany, also called homraya or murraya), and lulu (blackish scaly
bark and tufted leaves, gutta-percha tree, above described).</p>

<p>The quality of the forests is at present not high. The best
forests are those found in the broad, uninhabited stretch between
Deim Zubeir and the Bongo, but even here the frequency of fires has
prevented the stock from being at all uniform. In other places,
where fires are still more frequent, and where there are traces of
former cultivation, the stock is of a much more patchy character,
and degenerates into curtains of forest surrounding blanks, or into
mere scrub composed of contorted shoots of habil, dorut, kalto,
akan, grewia, etc. It is, however, satisfactory to note that, even
in such fireworn areas, there are still to be seen scattered here
and there enormous trees such as shande, homra, bei, nwana, etc.
But at the same time it is also a fact that, except in the case of
koba, which reproduces itself fairly freely, the other large trees
are not at all largely represented among those of younger
generations, notwithstanding the fact that most of them seed
abundantly. The most that can be said of these forests is that the
larger trees are very fairly represented and that with proper
treatment and protection some magnificent reserves could be
evolved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Principal timber trees.</span>Homra:
enormous size, would make a fine cabinet wood. Pinkish inside, but
soon turns mahogany brown; found on ironstone.</p>

<p>Heglig: not very tall, but 6 to 8 feet in girth. Timber durable
and not liable to attack by white ants; lowlands, clayey soil.</p>

<p>Koba: graceful, rounded crown, flat pods, abundant, good brown
building timber, much used by Jurs; highland.</p>

<p>Digdig: large tree, straight bole, sweet yellow flowers,
leafless during the cold season, strong yellowish timber;
highland.</p>

<p>Ardeib: grows large, timber of very old trees is beautiful,
mottled black and white, much valued in cabinet trade and also for
its fruit; clayey soil.</p>

<p>Abu surug: large, fine dark red wood, capable of good polish,
used chiefly by iron smelters for charcoal, bark rich in tannin;
common in highlands.</p>

<p>Nwana: very large and abundant, white timber, not strong, but
useful for planking, seed pulp sweet and edible, bark (âmudusâ)
good for tanning; ironstone.</p>

<p>Silag: common, tall, graceful, birchlike, white timber fairly
durable, much used for building, leaves probably rich in tannin;
highland tree.</p>

<p>Gughan: ebony family, sometimes very large, fine dark brown
timber which turns black on exposure, much used for gun stocks;
clay soil.</p>

<p>Abnus: Sudan ebony (not true ebony), crooked and thinnish;
scattered on rocky soil in highlands.</p>

<p>Zeitun: teak family, large size, white wood, not strong;
lowlands or clayey soil in highlands.</p>

<p>Bamboo: apparently strong and good, used for rafts and roofing;
line banks of khors in highlands.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fibres.</span>The mottled-leaved
<i>Sanseviera guineensis</i> is found all over the portion of the
province visited. It yields a strong and durable fibre. Strong
jungle ropes for building are made with a species of vitis growing
in the highland forests, while grewias and sterculias yield strong
best fibre. In the Nyam Nyam country the bark of a fig is used as
cloth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Edible fruits.</span>Many trees in these
forests yield edible fruits, but most of them are poor and insipid,
with the exception of lulu, which has a fruit, the pulp of which is
not only eaten, but the kernel yields an edible oil which is said
to be a good substitute for âghee.â Klato has a not unpleasant
acidulated fruit, and the fruits of both apwama and odilo are also
eaten. The pods of the nwana contain a sweet farinaceous pulp; and
a gardenia has a large ovoid fruit, which is not unlike a very
inferior apple. The fruit of zeitun is also eaten, and when roasted
and ground it makes an excellent substitute for tea.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Iron smelting.</span>It is impossible to
omit mention of a very important industry which is connected with,
but would be impossible in this province without an adequate supply
of fuel. Iron smelting is carried on with a certain activity by
Jurs and Bongos. The ironstone and laterite, which form the upper
layer of rocks over a great portion of the province, are very rich
in iron<a id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a>; and, with proper working, all the needs of
the Sudan, and possibly also of Upper Egypt, could be supplied from
this province. For this, however, it will be necessary to work the
forest in a systematic manner in order to make sure of a continuous
supply.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span><a id=
"p1c07s08"></a>8. <em>Communications and Transport.</em></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport.</span>The chief difficulty to
contend with in the Bahr El Ghazal is that of transport. During the
rainy season (May or June to November) since a large portion of the
country is flooded, it is almost impossible to get about. Stores
have, therefore, to be laid in beforehand during the dry
season.</p>

<p>Between Meshra El Rek and Wau the direct road is practically
closed from the middle of June to the middle of November, though
communication by single individuals is possible by a roundabout
route during this period.</p>

<p>Between Wau and Rumbek the road is difficult, though never
entirely closed, from August to November. The same applies to the
Wau-Deim Zubeir road.</p>

<p>Between Rumbek and Shambe (on the Nile) the road is impassable
for animals from the end of April or May till early December. In
October, 1903, nearly the whole of this route was actually under
water.</p>

<p>On all the above-mentioned roads, however, carriers with light
loads can get about, though with difficulty, all the year
round.</p>

<p>As thick bush and forest prevail almost throughout, the routes
everywhere are merely narrow tracks with tortuous windings, which
can only be traversed in single file. When the grass grows long,
high overhead in the autumn, the tracks are not easy to find. The
main Government routes, however, have been much improved.</p>

<p>Carrier transport is the most suitable, but carriers in great
numbers are not easily procurable and are never obtained from the
Dinkas. The Golos, Bongos, Ndoggos and Nyam Nyams are willing to
carry. The ordinary load for a man is 40 to 50 lbs. besides his own
food.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mules. Donkeys. Camels.</span>Mules and
donkeys can be used along most of the routes. Mules, especially the
Abyssinian breed, answer best. Donkeys are useful but die in great
numbers. Camels have been successfully employed from Shambe to
Rumbek and from Meshra El Rek to Wau and Tonj river post during the
dry season; but the rainy season does not agree with them, and
nearly all have died. In the rainy season camels cannot move, and
mules and donkeys only with difficulty. The chief causes of
mortality amongst all transport animals are overwork, fly, bad
roads and poisonous grasses. It is doubtful how far the climate
shares in causing these losses. Practically all transport animals
have to be brought into the country. Generally speaking, mules and
donkeys thrive better than camels.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Oxen.</span>Rough carts drawn by oxen are
being tried, and have given good results so far. Each cart carries
a load of 600 lbs. Pack oxen are slow, and require much time for
grazing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fly.</span>In the rainy season a fly,
resembling the common horse-fly, attacks horses, donkeys, and
mules, and cattle in certain rocky districts. At Wau this pest is
particularly prevalent. The animals generally sicken and die in a
fortnight. This fly is well known to the natives. As before stated
a species of Tsetse fly has been identified on the Bongo River,
<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_157">p. 157.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">River transport.</span>Below Meshra El
Rek steamers ply on the Bahr El Ghazal, but from the end of April
till the end of August they are stopped at the mouth of the Jur, or
even to the north of it. Light craft can generally get through to
Meshra El Rek during that period, but with much difficulty.</p>

<p>The Jur river is now open to navigation for small steamers and
light craft from August till the end of November, as far as Wau,
and even to Rafili, the sudd having been cleared to a great extent
from its mouth to Wau. During the rest of the year it is only
navigable for about half this latter distance from the mouth. In
June, in spite of rains, it is almost dry (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_154">p. 154</a>).</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s09"></a>9. <em>The Tribes of the Bahr El
Ghazal.</em></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>The <span class=
"sc">Dinkas</span> occupy the lowlands in the north of the
province, their southern limit being the edge of the table-land,
where the good grazing and pasture land terminates.</p>

<p>On the lower slopes of the ironstone plateaux, between Rumbek
and the Bongo river, there are many Jur settlements. Between the
Tonj and Bongo rivers are a few villages of the <span class=
"sc">Bongo</span> tribe, which have survived the raids of the
<span class="sc">Nyam Nyams</span> from the south. <span class=
"sc">Golos</span>, <span class="sc">Ndoggos</span>, and
<span class="sc">Kreich</span>, who formerly held the country west
of Wau to Deim Zubeir, have been driven further north by the same
powerful tribe, and have taken refuge in the district between Wau
and Chamamui, where they are now more or less under the protection
of the <span class="sc">Dinkas</span>. South of these tribes, and
separated from them by a broad belt of uninhabited forest about 100
miles wide, are the <span class="sc">Nyam Nyams</span>.</p>

<p>In the west the <span class="sc">Mandalla</span> tribe live in
Telgona district, but the ruling classes in that district,
including Sultan Nasser Andel, have Arab blood in them, introduced
through their relations with the tribes of Darfur. The same may be
said of the <span class="sc">Faroge</span> tribe, ruled by Sultan
Musa, who reads and writes Arabic. To the east, on the lower slopes
of the plateaux, are the <span class="sc">Mittu</span>,
<span class="sc">Wira</span>, and <span class="sc">Madi</span>
tribes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Dinkas.</span><span class="sc">The Dinkas</span>.âThere
is no ruling chief, but every little district has its own head man
or sheikh, and fighting frequently occurs between neighbouring
districts. A man is powerful in proportion to the number of cattle
he owns and the size of his family. Head men may own up to 30 or
even 40 wives, but six is a fair average. The great object of the
Dinka is to acquire cattle, to which they pay a kind of reverence.
Owing to in-breeding the produce of cattle is not numerous. The
yield of milk is insignificant. The price of a wife<a id=
"FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a> varies from 25 to 40 head of cattle. A head
man is generally succeeded by his eldest son; and in this respect
the Dinkas are generally loyal. In character they are savage,
deceitful, and treacherous, but their domestic ties are strong.
Tending flocks and herds is the occupation of the Dinka. They are
very lazy, and cultivate only small crops; but they levy taxes of
corn and produce on the neighbouring Jurs and Golos.</p>

<p>The Dinkas are poor sportsmen. They do some fishing, chiefly
with spears in the pools of rivers during the dry season, but are
bad trackers and hunters of big game. Spears, long in shaft and
blade, made by the Jurs, and wooden clubs of hard wood or ebony are
their weapons. Tobacco is grown, chiefly for chewing, and
occasionally for smoking. Most of the men carry a plug of tobacco
behind the ear.</p>

<p>Dura crops ripen in September in the low-lying areas, being sown
in May. Lubia (beans), pumpkins, and monkey nuts are also
cultivated. Cow dung is used for fires. The ashes of charcoal and
cow dung are rubbed in the hair, and all over the body by the
cattle owners and young warriors.</p>

<p>The Dinkas are a tall, slim race of men, 5 feet 9 inches being a
fair average height, and the women about 5 feet 7 inches. The men
wear no clothing, but fantastic head-dresses decked with ostrich
feathers; they are fond of beads as ornaments. The women wear
numerous earrings of brass and a leather apron fore and aft. Brass
bracelets are worn by both men and women; ivory bracelets by the
men only. Compare also <a href="#Page_126">pp. 126</a> to 130 and
pp. <a href="#Page_132">132</a> and <a href=
"#Page_144">144.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Jurs.</span><span class="sc">The
Jurs</span>.âThe Jurs are very like the Dinkas in appearance, the
skin being perhaps a shade lighter, but in habits they are more
civilised and peaceful. They are said to have originally been a
branch of the Shilluk tribe. Their language is quite different from
the Dinkas, but most of them speak and understand the language of
the latter, to whom they are subservient.</p>

<p>Living on the northern slope of the ferruginous table-land,
where ore is easily obtained from the surface, the Jurs practise
iron-smelting, with small furnaces about 4 feet high from the
ground. âMalotsâ (small hand-trowels used for turning the soil),
spears, cowbells, and axes are made in this way.</p>

<p>Dura is cultivated extensively, but is later than the Dinka
crops, ripening in November. This may be said of all the dura grown
in the plateaux and higher ground away from the marshes.</p>

<p>The Jurs understand tracking, and are accustomed to setting
rough traps for lion, leopard, and hyena.</p>

<p>The women, like the Dinkas, wear leather aprons, bracelets and
anklets of brass or iron. A wife costs from 40 to 50 malots, or 20
or 30 sheep and goats. The men are fond of clothing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Golos.</span><span class="sc">The
Golos</span>.âThe Golos are an intelligent, active race, willing to
learn and to work.</p>

<p>The cultivation of crops is their chief occupation. Besides dura
and Indian corn they grow telabun, dukhn, lubia, simsim, onions,
sweet potatoes, water melons, pumpkins and âbedingan.â They keep a
few sheep and many fowls, but no cattle.</p>

<p>The huts are well built, with ventilation between the wall and
roof, and are clean both inside and outside.</p>

<p>âMalotsâ (iron hoes) are bought from the Jurs for honey, skins,
labour, etc. A wife costs 40 malots.</p>

<p>The men are fond of clothes, and are generally clad like the
Sudanese over the rest of the Sudan. They are fairly skilful
weavers, using the cotton of the country, which, however, is not
extensively cultivated. The women, on the contrary, are content
with a bunch of leaves fore and aft, but are fond of beads.</p>

<p>The Golos are good sportsmen and trackers. They possess a fair
number of guns, chiefly old traders and Remington rifles, but have
very little ammunition. Bows and arrows and elbow knives are other
weapons used.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bongos.</span><span class="sc">The
Bongos</span>.âThe Bongos have the same occupations and appearance
as the Golos, but are rather shorter and more thick-set.</p>

<p>The women wear a large circular stone on the upper lip or a
wooden plug pierced through the lower.</p>

<p>Decimated by the Nyam Nyams and slave-traders, very few of them
practise the crafts that they were formerly skilled in. Like the
Jurs, they are accustomed to smelting ore and working in iron.
Their dexterity in wood carving is shown in the various utensils,
stools, spoons, etc., which they still make. Great attention and
trouble is devoted to basket work and weaving grass mats.</p>

<p>The Bongos are fond of music, and play with string and wind
instruments.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ndoggos and Kreich.</span><span class=
"sc">The Ndoggos and Kreich</span>.âThe Ndoggos and Kreich are
similar to the Golos and Bongos in appearance, but not so comely as
the former and not so short as the Bongos. They are slightly fairer
in skin. Having formerly lived prosperously in the districts where
the old Government posts were established (Deim Zubeir, Deim Bekir,
Deim Idris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> Wau,
and Jur Ghattas), these tribes, Dinkas excepted, clearly realise
the protection and other benefits accorded by a civilised
Government.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nyam Nyams.</span><span class="sc">The
Nyam Nyams</span>.âThe Nyam Nyams or Azande are the most
intelligent, keen and well-ordered tribe in the Bahr El Ghazal
province.</p>

<p>The tribeâcovering, roughly, the south-west third of the
province and a portion of the Congo Free State and Haut Ubangi to
the south and west of the Nile-Congo watershedâis split up into
five districts, each governed by a chief, holding absolute power,
and these chiefs form two factions, which constantly quarrel.</p>

<p>Tembura, Zemio and Sasa make the western faction; Ndoruma and
Yambio the eastern.</p>

<p>Colonel Sparkes, says in the account of his patrol to Temburaâs
country:â</p>

<p>âTembura is a shrewd, intelligent man, anxious for progress and
development, and the Nyam Nyams generally are far superior to any
other people I have met up here.</p>

<p>âTemburaâs standing army, which is quartered round him, consists
of about 4,000 men, of whom 1,000 have rifles or guns of sorts, and
the rest spears, bows and arrows. They look after and handle their
guns exceedingly well, and have been taught a certain amount of
drill by the French.</p>

<p>âBesides quantities of dura, the Nyam Nyams grow bananas, limes,
tomatoes, sweet potatoes, sugar cane, manioc, onions, and many
other sorts of vegetables. Excepting a few of the head men, they
have no cattle, sheep or goats, though quantities of fowls are kept
everywhere.</p>

<p>âYambio has the largest number of people under him, but is the
least civilised, never having been brought into direct contact with
Europeans, as have the others.â</p>

<p>The Nyam Nyams are great hunters, and all the chiefs possess a
considerable quantity of ivory. The men wear well-woven straw hats,
with cockâs feathers, and loose breeches made of âRokoâ bark.</p>

<p>The women are clad like the Golos and Bongos, but are more
reserved and retiring than the latter. Both men and women dress
their hair, grown long, in various styles. Beards are cultivated
and are greatly admired if long.</p>

<p>Of cannibalism amongst the Nyam Nyams there is not much heard,
but it is a fact that they eat their enemies who have fallen in
battle and those who die. They eat dogs when they can get them.
Schweinfurth considers this custom as allied to cannibalism.</p>

<p>Lighter coloured than the other tribes, they consider themselves
âwhite men.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Country, etc.</span>Both Tembura and
Yambio have a fine country, perhaps the cream of the Bahr El
Ghazal, well watered by flowing streams, undulating, and growing
many lulu, banana, and other fine trees. The country teems with
many kinds of game: elephant, eland, rhinoceros, and buffalo all
being numerous, the former especially so. The Nyam Nyams
manufacture a white cotton cloth, similar to fine sacking. They are
practically all clothed, and would probably readily purchase
cloth.</p>

<p>Their arms are bows, arrows and spears, but both these sultans
now possess a considerable number of rifles.</p>

<p>They were formerly, in the old Government days, converts to
Islam, but they (Tembura at any rate) both now merely believe in
the existence of a God, without participating in any form of
religion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mittu, Madi and Wira.</span><span class=
"sc">The Mittu, Madi, and Wira Tribes</span>.âThese tribes, living
on the eastern border of the Nyam Nyams, resemble the Bongos, but
are physically inferior to the latter. They have suffered too, in
the same way as the Bongos, from the raids of the Nyam Nyams.</p>

<p>The Madi and Wira tribes are really sub-tribes of the Mittu, and
they all speak the same Mittu dialect.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Teeth.</span>Regarding the teeth of the
different tribes:â</p>

<p>Jurs and Dinkas extract the lower incisors; the Nyam Nyams file
the upper incisors to a point; Golos, Ndoggos, Bongos, and Belandas
file the upper incisor only on the inner aspect. But many of the
latter, who have been brought up in the Nyam Nyam country, have the
tooth-marks of that tribe. In fact, the tooth distinction is
becoming less characteristic, owing to interchanging of tribes.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c07s11"></a>11. <em>Religious Beliefs among the
Natives of the Bahr El Ghazal.</em><a id=
"FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a></h3>

<p>In making enquiries as to religious beliefs among the people
here, one is met at the outset by two difficulties. The first and
greater is the reticence displayed on such subjects by the natives,
and the second is that the interpreter, being invariably an
Arabic-speaking native who has with his Arabic acquired the Moslem
faith, is liable to colour his translations with ideas of his own;
partly out of shame for the beliefs he has discarded, and partly
from his anxiety to tell you what he thinks you expect.
Perseverance in this line of enquiry is, however, well repaid, as
the primitive religions of the tribes in the Bahr El Ghazal are
most interesting and suggestive.</p>

<p>The Dinkas, though the most difficult of all to approach on such
subjects, appear to have a most elaborate list of gods and
demi-gods. At the head of the Divine community are Deng-dit (Rain
Giver) and Abok, his wife. They have two sons, KÃ»r Konga, the
elder, and Gurung-dit, the younger, and a daughter called
Ai-Yak.</p>

<p>Their devil is called LâwÃ¢l BurrajÃ´k, and is the father of AbÃ´k,
the wife of Deng-dit. There are also other relatives.</p>

<p>Their story of the origin of mankind (or it may be of the Dinka
tribe) is curious and poetical. Deng-dit gave to his wife, AbÃ´k, a
bowl of fat, and she and her children, softening the fat over the
fire, proceeded to mould from it men and women, in the image of
gods. Deng-dit warned her against LâwÃ¢l (the Shaitan), who was
suspected to have ill-intentions towards Deng-dit. But AbÃ´k forgot,
and with her children went to gather wood in the forest. There
LâwÃ¢l found the bowl, drank the greater part of the fat, and from
the remainder proceeded to mould caricatures of men and women, with
distorted limbs, mouths, and eyes. Then, fearing the vengeance of
Deng-dit, he descended to earth by the path that then connected it
with heaven. On discovering the result of her neglect, AbÃ´k
hastened to her husband, who, greatly incensed, started in pursuit
of LâwÃ¢l. The latter, however, had persuaded the bird Atoitoish to
bite asunder with its bill the path from heaven to earth, and thus
escaped from the Divine wrath.</p>

<p>In spite of this complicated mythology, the Dinkas appear to be
very indifferent to religion as an active principle in life. They
are without any plan of prayer, and though they assert that their
forefathers made great sacrifices to God, the present generation
thinks twice about parting with a goatâto say nothing of a cowâfor
sacrificial purposes. Sacrifices constitute, however, their only
attempts at intercourse with God. In fact, they seem to regard him
not as a being likely to confer benefits, but as a destructive
power to be propitiated, if possible.</p>

<p>The Golos also believe in male and female deities, called Umvili
and Barachi, respectively. This couple is said to have originated
the human race, and to be the parents of mankind. This belief is, I
think, common to the Golo, NâDoggo, Shere, and Belanda tribes, and
possibly also to the A-Zande or Nyam Nyams.</p>

<p>They have vague ideas as to future bliss for worthy, and
punishment for evil, doers; the execution of the latter is
entrusted to a spirit called Ma-ah, who corresponds to Shaitan, but
is the servant rather than the enemy of God; some of the Golo songs
in common use are of the nature of moral exhortations, directing
the people to hear the voice of God.</p>

<p>Like the Dinkas, they do not pray to God, but attempt to appease
him with sacrifices of chickens. These sacrifices are rather
one-sided, as the procedure is to kill 20 chickens, cook and eat
19, and throw out the twentieth for Umvili.</p>

<p>Golos and Dinkas both associate the ideas of reverence and
divinity with the sky, and of malignity and punishment with the
bowels of the earth; pointing upwards to their gods and downwards
to their devils. This association is, I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_163">[163]</span> believe, universal, and has probably its
origin in Sun worship. The natural human instinct for religion is
probably as deeply rooted in the Bahr El Ghazal as elsewhere, and
manifests itself perhaps in the readiness with which these tribes
embrace Islam, when they learn about it in Sudanese regiments or as
servants to Moslem masters.</p>

<p>They would seem to offer a hopeful and legitimate field for
judicious missionary work,<a id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> as they are far from
being the savages, destitute of ideas and beliefs, that they appear
on a superficial view.</p>

<td class="tdc-top">â</td>
<td class="tdl-top hang1">Proceeding up-stream westwards from the
junction of the Bahr El Jebel and the White Nile, Lake No is
immediately entered. Lake No is known to the Arabs as the
âMoghren-el-Buhur,â or the âMeeting of the Rivers.â It is situated
in north latitude 9Â° 29â². It is a shallow expanse of water covering
a good many square miles of area, and surrounded on all sides by
reedy marsh. It is probably a portion of the great lake which once
covered this country. Through its eastern end the Bahr El Jebel
passes, and the Bahr El Ghazal enters it at its western extremity.
Lake No acts as a reservoir for the waters of the sluggish streams
which drain the extensive plateaux forming the watershed between
the Congo and the Nile. These streams find their rise in an area
lying between latitude 5Â° and 8Â° north, and longitude 24Â° and 30Â°
east. The channel by which their united waters are delivered to the
Nile is the Bahr El Ghazal, and from it the province through which
it passes receives its name. Its chief affluents are the Rohl, the
Jau, and the Tonj on the right, and the Bahr El Arab, the Bahr El
Homr, and the Jur on the left. The water thus brought down fills up
the depression known as Lake No, over which area the water of the
Bahr El Jebel spreads. The consequence is that this lake is an
expanse of water through which little or no current passes, but
whose levels rise and fall with that of the Nile. The flooded area
changes according to the season of the year. It forms an important
reservoir for the White Nile. The actual extent of Lake No is
difficult to ascertain. It has been variously estimated at from 20
to 40 square miles. These differences are probably due to the fact
that the area was estimated at different periods of the year.
During maximum flood the extent cannot be much less than the larger
estimate, but at the period of low supply the area is much reduced,
and in 1900 and 1901 could hardly have exceeded 8 square miles. In
the early months of these years the surface had shrunk to very
small dimensions, and more resembled a large river than a lake. The
width, during the period of low Nile, is extremely variable. Thus
in April, 1901, in the first mile from the White Nile, the open
water surface was at times under 200 yards, and then suddenly
widened out to, perhaps, 2 miles; a little further on it again
contracted, and for 4 or 5 miles more varied from 300 to 600 yards.
The depth, at that time, was nowhere more than 7 feet, and, in
places, only 4 feet. No current at all was visible through any
portion of the lake. Beyond the open water stretched a broad belt
of flooded reeds. This belt was chiefly composed of âUm Suf,â with
clumps of ambach. The open water itself was full of reedy islands.
Lake No abounds with hippopotami and waterfowl. The former cause a
good deal of trouble to the Nuer population, as they are unusually
savage in this locality, and are said to make a practice of
attacking any canoe or raft crossing the lake. The bank to the
north of the eastern end swarms with lion and antelope of every
description (January, 1903).</td>

Landing possible. At 6 miles from the White Nile a continuous line
of Nuer villages runs parallel to the left bank of the channel for
several miles, and marks the ridge beyond which the swamping does
not extend. Their average distance is some 2 miles from the river.
The villages appear to be thickly populated, and the inhabitants
possess large herds of cattle, sheep, and goats; they now barter
their fowls, &amp;c., with readiness.</td>

Jebel junction (whilst still within Lake No) and westwards the
channel is, in dry weather, reduced to 80 or 90 yards wide. In
flood-time the line of the channel is not visible. This channel is
by some termed the Khor El Deleb, in continuation of a khor of that
name which flows into it at the western end of Lake No; but as the
Bahr El Ghazal is obviously the main stream, the latter name has
been applied to it here from the Bahr El Jebel junction westwards.
About 10 miles west of the Bahr El Jebel mouth take southern

it closes up and comes to a dead end 5 miles on. Large village,

deep in March. Sudd seen floating down stream, 1Â½ miles an hour.
Leave broad open channel, which bifurcates 2 miles farther on, and
becomes the Deleb and Signorina backwaters, ending 18 miles up.
Take northern channel, which is now the Bahr El Ghazal. The Khor
Deleb, which enters the river from the south at the western point
of the lake, is a wide expanse of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_166">[166]</span> channel 150 to 200 yards in breadth. It
forms the outlet for the waters of the River Rohl, coming from the
south. In summer no current at all is apparent. The Ghazal River at
this point, with a width of some 40 yards, is in appearance a more
insignificant stream than the other. Its depth, however, is
greater, averaging 13 feet, as against 6 or 7 feet in the Deleb.
The Khor Deleb was explored by Major Peake for some 18 miles above
this junction. At this point it was blocked by sudd and reeds, with
trees on both banks, so that further progress was impossible. It
had, however, a decided stream coming through the reeds, which left
the Ghazal 33 miles higher up. The transparency of the waters
differs in the two channels; that of the Khor Deleb being opaque
and of a whitey-grey colour, while that of the Bahr El Ghazal is
clear and limpid, like that of the White Nile itself. Between the
two rivers, which run parallel for some distance, is an expanse of
low marsh, a foot above low- water level. This whole area must
resemble a large lake when the rivers are in flood, and the aspect
of the country is desolate and monotonous to an extreme degree. It
is absolutely treeless; the atmosphere is damp and warm even in the
winter months, and the mosquitoes are of a peculiarly venomous
variety.</td>

<td rowspan="2" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">Proceeding up the
Bahr El Ghazal, for a long way there is little change in the
landscape. The low banks continue, and the stream winds about
through the marshes with a very feeble velocity. At 18 miles a
large khor joins the Bahr El Ghazal on the left bank. This is known
as the Mayyet ElÃ©ri, and appears to come from a north-westerly
direction. It is this khor which has been supposed to be the
junction between the Bahr El Ghazal and the LollÃ©. From the slope
of the country, however, it would seem that water flows from the
higher land into the Bahr El Ghazal. It is possible that in flood
there may be a spill in the opposite direction. This khor, although
200 yards in width, is very shallow. At 21 miles the Khor Deleb
approaches to within 1,200 yards of the Bahr El Ghazal. A solitary
deleb palm (mentioned by Junker) forms a fine landmark on the right
bank. The Khor Deleb derives its name from this palm. The left bank
of the river beyond the fringe of swamp is an extensive grass plain
covered with ant-hills. These are so close together that they
somewhat resemble a gigantic grave-yard. The Nuer villages are now
a long way from the bank. As the river is ascended the country
becomes more and more hopeless-looking. Flat grass plains extend to
the horizon, and a wide band of swamp borders either side of the
waterway. The channel narrows, and in places is not more than 25
yards. The depth is from 12 to 16 feet, and the turns and bends,
though not as sharp as on the Bahr El Zeraf, are endless. The
difference between the Bahr El Zeraf and the Bahr El Ghazal is very
striking. The water of the former during the period of low supply
is considerably below its banks; in the latter it is almost level
with them. The rise of the former, even in ordinary flood, is not
less than 6 to 6Â½ feet. That of the Bahr El Ghazal, on the
contrary, must be very small. It is difficult to imagine that even
in flood the water can rise more than 3, or at most, 4 feet over
its lowest level. Even with such a rise, the area of the country
under water would be enormous, and the flooding would extend for a
very long distance. A few miles further up the depth of water
increases to 19 feet, and in places to 25 feet. For the first time
forest appears in the distance on the left, but several thousand
yards away from the river. The right bank is now covered with low
bush and scrub beyond the flooded line. The country bordering the
Bahr El Ghazal does not have the appearance of being under water
for any length of time, even in flood. In this respect, again, it
differs from that traversed by the Bahr El Zeraf. It must, however,
be saturated and resemble a sponge in the rainy season. There
cannot be more than a very shallow film of water over these plains,
or the bush and scrub would not flourish as it does; neither would
ant-hills be found in such quantities. The general slope of the
country is so low that the water must drain off extremely
slowly.</td>

<td rowspan="4" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">At mile 31 the width
is 60 yards, and the reed-belt gets narrower; a very large
âmayyeh,â or khor, comes in on the left bank here. This is known as
the Mayyeh Nur, or the Mayyeh Mahmud Effendi. Its width near the
junction is from 150 to 200 yards, and its general direction
appears to be west. It is very shallow. This mayyeh is said to
receive the waters of the Keilak River (Mayyeh bâta Komandari (?)),
a stream about which little is known, but which is supposed to rise
in the hills of Dar Nuba. There is a wooding-station on right bank
opposite the Nur. Up-stream of this junction the Bahr El Ghazal
takes a more southerly direction. The two streams run for some
miles parallel to one another, from 600 to 700 yards apart. The
country between the two is, perhaps, 2 feet over the water. At mile
35, the first papyrus seen since leaving the White Nile is met
with. From this point on, for many miles, a band of this reed
fringes both edges of the water. It is never so high as on the Bahr
El Jebel, nor does it grow here in such dense luxuriance as on that
stream. The water surface is very narrow, often not more than 20
yards, but the depth is considerable, averaging from 15 to 19 feet.
The reed-birds here are an extraordinary sight. They are
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> be seen in
myriads and resemble a flight of locusts. The SerÃ»t fly is very bad
on the Bahr El Ghazal. The ant-hills certainly form a distinctive
feature of the Ghazal scenery. Nowhere else are they so large or so
numerous. They are generally from 20 to 50 yards apart. At mile 49
good halting or camping ground, fairly dry; bushes and trees right.
Large clump of big trees Â½ mile away south. This clump is close to
the stream running into Mayyeh Deleb. From here on, channel very
narrow; papyrus both sides; liable to be blocked with sudd at any
time; large islands of sudd are met, often taking up whole width of
stream up to the junction with the Bahr El Arab, where river is
much wider again. Mayyeh right: river bends sharply, channel only
width of steamer, 17 feet; current very fast; numbers of owls and
BalÃ¦niceps Rex seen about, also hippopotami; some wood left, 500
yards away. Large trees left, close to water, good for fuel;
village on horizon right, and two Dom palms; channel opens up. At
mile 53 wooding-station left. The papyrus belt gets wider as the
river is ascended, and at 57 miles the forest on the left bank
comes down close to the waterâs edge and the river skirts it for
some 2 miles. The trees are large, but the belt is only a few
hundred yards wide.</td>

<td rowspan="5" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">The scenery here is
beautiful, as the ground is high and glades of fine trees are
scattered about the grassy plain. Many elephants are to be seen. On
the right bank is a wide marsh through which the river channel has
evidently wandered at times. This is the beginning of the reach in
which the Bahr El Ghazal is occasionally closed by sudd. At 61
miles, in 1880, Marno found his first block here, and in November,
1898, and April, 1899, it was blocked. Large solitary tree right
bank. The channel is very narrow, deep, and winding. At present it
runs under the high bank, but it is clear that it could easily be
blocked at one of the many bends, and in such a case it would
doubtless form a series of lagoons and mayyehs in the adjacent
papyrus marsh. After leaving the left bank forest for a time the
river at mile 62 again returns to it. The depth of the channel
suddenly decreases to 5 feet, but soon deepens again to 10 and 13
feet. This shoal is doubtless caused by decomposed sudd which has
sunk to the bottom. Such a bar is one of the frequent causes of a
block. The sudd raises the bed level, and other masses floating
down ground upon the obstruction and the channel is speedily
closed. The Bahr El Ghazal has evidently changed its course here
very recently. It is now much closer to the left bank than it was
in 1899. The change has probably been caused by a block of sudd. It
was near here, <em>i.e.</em>, at mile 63, that Gessi Pasha had such
a disastrous experience in January, 1880. His steamers, on
descending this river, were imprisoned in the sudd for some 6
weeks, and he lost over 100 men. Had it not been for the opportune
arrival of Marno in the âBordeinâ none of the party could have
escaped. They were on the verge of starvation and it was impossible
to obtain fuel for the steamers, being cut off from the shore by an
impassable swamp. These 6 or 7 miles of the Bahr El Ghazal must
always be more or less dangerous, as regards possible closure by
sudd, at certain seasons of the year. In 1900 and 1901 the channel
was open, but in the spring of 1899 it was closed not far up-stream
of this point. The channel is extremely contracted, having a width
of only 12 yards and a depth of 13 feet. The course is so tortuous
that it is difficult to follow all the turns. The whole of this
area must, in the rainy seasons, be a reedy lake. At mile 64 the
river emerges from this dreadful marsh and the width increases to
30 yards. The banks average 2Â½ feet above water level. The country
on either side is generally higher. On the right, bush is dotted
about, and the ant-hills reappear to the left in a large grassy
plain. At mile 65 the river widens into a lagoon, some 400 yards
broad, and a mile in length. At the up-stream end of this lagoon a
large mayyeh is said by the Arabs to form the outlet of the Jau
River, which is another of the tributary streams that feed the Bahr
El Ghazal from the south. This channel, which is known as the
Mayyeh Ahmed Arabi, runs more or less parallel to the Bahr El
Ghazal for some 40 miles, taking off it at Lake Ambadi, or 88 miles
from the point where the Ghazal and the Deleb join. It is often at
a considerable distance from the main stream, but glimpses are to
be seen of it at times. A fine tamarind-tree close to the edge of
the mayyeh assists recognition of this spot. In 1899 the Bahr El
Ghazal was blocked by sudd near this junction. The right bank
continues to be fairly high, but the left is low and must be
flooded for a long distance. The stream is now more rapid. The air
in the mornings here is cool and damp, but a strong marshy smell
prevails. At mile 74 wood-station left bank. Elephants, and the
Euphorbia first, appear. This shrub is fairly plentiful from this
point up-stream. For several miles there is little change in the
conditions, but at mile 79 trees are visible on the right bank,
about 1,500 yards from the river. The intermediate country is
flooded. A few Dinka are occasionally met with, but no villages.
The absence of human habitations on this river is very striking.
Since the Nuer villages were left behind at mile 43, not a sign of
life has been visible. A small but deep khor joins the river on the
left bank here.</td>

left bank. This channel, which was asserted by the boatmen to be
the Bahr El Arab, and which was ascended under this supposition,
flows from a north-westerly direction and evidently brings water
from a long distance. Later experience has proved that the Bahr El
Arab is several miles further up-stream, but this khor must,
nevertheless, bring down a large volume of water during the flood.
It is quite possible that it forms a second mouth of the Bahr El
Arab. It joins the Bahr El Ghazal through two small lakes or
lagoons, the largest being about 1,000 yards long by 800 yards
wide, with an island in the centre. These lakes are swarming with
hippopotami. The width of this khor is much greater that than that
of the Ghazal, being from 100 to 120 yards. It has a perceptible
though feeble current even in April, but its depth is shallow,
averaging from 4 to 5 feet. It was ascended for some 8 miles above
the junction, when shoal-water prevented further progress. Its
general direction is north-west, but at the furthest point reached
it turns sharply to the north, and its course can be traced for a
long distance, winding through the country. Even here its width is
100 yards, with wide-stretching mud-flats on either side. It runs
between flat plains covered with low grass and averaging 2Â½ feet
over the water at the riverâs edge. It differs remarkably from the
Ghazal in its characteristics, particularly in the absence of the
reed fringe which distinguishes the main river. Its rise must be
small, as the banks show no trace of flooding.</td>

This forest is known as the âGhaba bâta el Arab,â and is one of the
few wooding-stations to be found on the river. The trees upon both
banks are different from those found elsewhere. There are a few
mimosas, but the bulk are very thorny trees with bright green
leaves. The belt of wood is about half a mile in width, back from
the river. Behind it are open spaces of grass, through which broad
and shallow lagoons wind. In this plain are many large clumps of
trees. Except in the depressions, the country here is certainly not
flooded, even in the rainy season. The marks on the banks show that
the maximum rise of the river is not more than 3 feet. The Bahr El
Arab is a broad well-defined channel, from 40 to 100 yards in
width, and confined between well-marked, but swampy, banks. Its
direction, at the junction, is due north, but about 3 miles further
up it turns more to the west and runs apparently through forest.
Next to nothing is known of this river. Felkin crossed it in
December, 1879, and found it, 300 miles from its mouth, 120 yards
wide, with banks 15 feet above low water. He noted that in the
rainy season it flooded the surrounding country. It is impossible
to investigate this river, as, at some 1,300 yards above the
junction, it is closed by sudd and reeds. It has no current at the
mouth, and its depth is from 10 to 11 feet at low water. The water
of the Bahr El Arab is singularly clear and free from sediment.
Reports received in the spring of 1901 show that this river is
still blocked by sudd. Immediately up-stream of the Bahr El Arab
junction the Lake Kit, or Ambadi, begins. The Bahr El Ghazal
traverses this lake, but from this point its nomenclature changes,
and the river is known as the âKit,â or âKeit,â by the natives, and
as such is entered on many maps. At mile 105, Lake Ambadi is
divided into two parts by a large grassy island, about a mile in
length, the right channel being 400 yards, and the left 150 yards
wide. Half-way up the right channel, the large Mayyeh Ahmed Arabi,
previously alluded to, rejoins the Bahr El Ghazal. It has a width
of 500 to 600 yards here. The swamps surrounding this lake are of
considerable breadth, especially on the left side. They are very
low and reedy, and a very small rise in the water levels must
increase the flooded area enormously. It is impossible to calculate
the width of the swamps on the left bank. They appear to extend for
many miles from the waterâs edge. Lake Ambadi has an average depth
of 10 feet, in the deepest parts of the channel, but shoals rapidly
on either side. It is evidently the great reservoir of the
Bahr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> El Ghazal,
receiving the waters of the swamps and the southern rivers, and
slowly discharging them by means of the narrow but deep channel of
the Ghazal itself. At low water it has a length of about 10 miles
by an average breadth of 1 mile; in flood-time the area must be
very much greater. It is a great nursery for certain of the sudd
grasses, but chiefly those of the âswimmingâ variety. The
<i>Azolla</i>, <i>Utricularia</i>, <i>Aldrovandia</i>,
<i>Otellia</i>, and many other kinds are found upon its waters. The
<i>Pistia</i> is conspicuous by its absence. Among the reeds in the
swamps a certain amount of <i>Vossia procera</i> and <i>Saccharum
spontaneum</i> is met with, but not in such proportion as on the
Bahr El Jebel. The papyrus does not exist on this lake, nor does
the ambach. Except between miles 35 and 82, the former is not found
at all on the Bahr El Ghazal, and it only grows in real luxuriance
between miles 65 and 77. After Lake No is passed, ambach is not
found in the Bahr El Ghazal. The absence of papyrus and âum sÃ»fâ is
probably the reason why the sudd in this river is so much less
tenacious and is so much lighter in consistency than than that of
the Bahr El Jebel. [Col. Peake, however, speaks of the sudd here as
being of a âvery tough and felt-like consistency.â] Lake Ambadi is
the home of large numbers of the rare BalÃ¦niceps Rex. The
evaporation upon the lake must be very great during the hottest
months. With two large and shallow sheets of water like Lakes
Ambadi and No, the amount of water discharged by the Bahr El Ghazal
must be largely reduced before it reaches the White Nile.</td>

<td rowspan="3" class="tdl-top hang1 bd-left">At mile 114 the lake
stops and the river recommences. This is the Kit, properly so
called. Its width here is from 100 to 120 yards and its depth 10 to
11 feet. The current is so feeble as to be almost imperceptible.
The Bahr El Homr comes in near this point. On the 1st October,
1900, Captain Sanders found the Bahr El Homr navigable for 5 miles;
after which it was blocked by sudd. Its width is 80 yards and
depth, 9 feet; direction N.N.W. Col. Peake places its junction 9
miles further down-stream. It appears to have no discharge in March
and April, and the water shoals so that it is impossible to explore
it. For the next 3 miles the Kit has a mean width of 180 yards. The
water surface suddenly narrows to a width of 20 yards, the
remainder of the channel being filled by sudd. In this block are
several reedy islands. The country is now a dead flat in every
direction. Even on these African rivers it is rare to see an
expanse giving a greater impression of flatness than does this. On
all sides marshes extend, apparently to the horizon. It is quite
impossible to arrive at an idea of their area. In these marshes are
many large lagoons. A little further up-stream, the channel widens
again from 35 to 40 yards, with a depth varying from 12 to 15 feet.
Occasionally it shoals to 6 feet, or less, probably owing to sunken
sudd upon the bed. Navigation at all seasons must be very
difficult, as the river winds and twists through the marshes. There
are no tall reeds here; nothing but floating plants, and the water
is choked with masses of decayed weed. It is a hopeless morass.
During stormy weather, this place is one of those where blocks are
often formed. There are no signs of life anywhere, with the
exception of the BalÃ¦niceps Rex, which are numerous. These horrible
marshes continue for another 6 or 8 miles. Sudd islands separate
the channel, in places, and the width varies greatly. At one point
of this reach, viz., at mile 120, the main channel of the Kit was
quite closed in March, 1900. The entire river was forced through a
small opening, 10 or 12 yards wide, through which a strong stream
was rushing, and in one place it was actually barred for 50 yards.
The total length of the block was about 500 yards. A more
loathsome-looking swamp it is difficult to imagine. The sudd in
this river is very different from that of the Bahr El Jebel. It is
impossible to walk on its surface, which resembles slime rather
than sudd, but which is bound into a mass by vegetable matter. The
chief ingredients appear to be the long trailing, swimming plants,
described as found on Lake Ambadi. It is not difficult to force a
way through it, but the stuff, when removed, does not float as does
that on the Jebel, but sinks and decays. Three miles on, the two
groups of trees called Matruk-el-Wabur (âthe landing-place of
steamers,â <em>vide</em> Junker) are passed on the left, about 2
miles from the main stream. A channel, at present blocked by sudd,
leads to the landing-place. Matruk-el-Wabur is an island of dry
land in a sea of swamp. When Col. Peake visited it in 1898 the
remains of the former French occupation were visible. The Egyptian
flag was hoisted here on the 28th September, 1898. Up-stream of
this point, for another 5 miles, the Kit winds about; the width of
the channel increases, averaging from 180 to 200 yards; its surface
is covered by myriads of water fowl, the whistling duck being
especially numerous; a few Dinka are to be seen, who have come down
to the river for the purpose of fishing and hunting the
hippopotamus. At mile 128 the channel bifurcates. The Kit itself
runs due south, in the direction of Meshra-el-Rek. The other branch
has a westerly direction, and receives the water of the Jur River,
which, again, forms the outlet for the Sueh and Wau Rivers. The
latitude of this junction, as observed in April, 1900,
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> 8Â° 44â² 50â³
north. The water at the time was so shallow that it was impossible
for the steamer to ascend the channel, the width of which was from
600 to 700 yards, with a depth of 3 feet. The water coming down
this stream was of a dark amber colour, and was evidently the
drainage of the marshes. A slight current was visible. The general
direction of the Kit is south or south-west. Captain Sanders, who
visited this place in September, 1900, found the Kit completely
blocked by sudd: but Lieutenant Fell, R.N., ascended it in November
of the same year, and reports that the water near the Meshra was
âfoul, stagnant, and very shallow.â In March, 1900, the sudd was
very light, mostly floating, and easily removed. Above this
junction, the expanse of water into which the Jur discharges itself
has a width of 400 yards, a depth of 10 feet, and a fair velocity,
even in the month of March. The marshes here are bewildering in
their extent.</td>

in June within 35, miles of the Jur mouth. Even when free of sudd,
the Jur is unnavigable, owing to its shallowness, from the first
week of December to the end of July. After strenuous exertions
during 2 years on the part of Lieutenant Fell and others, the Jur
has has now been cleared of sudd and a channel made for steamers up
to Wau, a distance of 160 miles. This enables stores, &amp;c., to
reach headquarters by water during 4 months of the year (August to
November, inclusive). The sudd is, however, quick-growing and grows
from the bottom. Sudd-cutting parties have, therefore, to be
annually employed during the low river time to clear a channel for
the flood-time. The average difference between high and low Jur is
as much as 15 feet; in flood-time the current is swift and the
river deep, whilst the reed beds on either side make towing
impossible. Luckily a north wind helps boats along up-stream.</td>

marshes extend for 2 or 3 miles. Mosquitoes swarm, and, owing to
the stagnant condition of the river, the water supply is very
indifferent during the dry season. No natives live within about 7
or 8 miles. The station consists of straw tuklsâthe hospital
standing on the one bit of high ground. Great difficulty in
building huts, as there is no wood suitable within several miles;
on the whole a most unhealthy place. High ground lies quite 5 miles
beyond the marsh. The French had a fort near our present post in an
even worse position.</td>

<h3><span class="sc">Section I.âKordofan</span>.</h3>

<h4><a id="p1c08s1a"></a>1. <em>General Description.</em></h4>

<p>The country between the Nile and the eastern frontier of Darfur
consists of vast plains broken in places by clusters of hills,
which rarely exceed 600 feet in height above the plain. In the
north, these plains are intersected by wadis which run down from
the hills and gradually lose themselves in the sand. The country is
thinly covered with low scrub, which becomes denser in the wadis.
Towards the south the khors gradually become less and less, until
about lat. 14Â° 30â² north they cease. Here the real bush country
commences, and the surface of the ground becomes more undulating.
There is no visible watershed, the rain sinking in where it
falls.</p>

<p>The northern plains, occupied by camel-owning tribes, consist
chiefly of reddish sand, which, if the rains are good, supports
plenty of coarse grass and crops of dukhn. Should they fail, even
the grass in the wadis does not afford grazing, and the wells give
out (1902-03).</p>

<p>In the undulating country between El Obeid and the river the
grey gum acacia (hashab) is the prevailing tree. The soil here
contains more clay than further north. Between Id El Ud and Zereiga
on the east, and Hashaba and Jebel Kon on the west, is a waterless
district called El Agaba, in which grows little but marakh bush and
coarse grass.</p>

<p>Between El Agaba and the river the ground falls, at first
abruptly, and then very gently, to the river. The sandy soil
gradually disappears, and along the bank is replaced by a strip of
black soil, in places, 12 miles wide. This soil is rich and is
generally overgrown with thick bush. On the river bank, and as far
inland as the floods at high Nile reach, large red sunt trees are
found. At high Nile these often stand in 3 or 4 feet of water.
During the rains this soil becomes a swamp, impassable for camels
in most places, the khors fill with water, and the roads near the
river go out of use. As soon as the rains stop and the river falls,
this soil dries up and cracks, and until the paths have been used
for some time the going is very bad.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dar Hamid.</span>In Dar Hamid, a large
district north-west of Bara, there is a series of basins running
from north to south, divided by steep ridges of red sand. At the
bottom of each basin, locally called a âkhor,â the soil is white,
sandy earth, containing much lime. Water is here found at a depth
of from 4 to 10 feet. These khors were formerly all cultivated by
Danagla, who used shadufs or saglias. The whole district, which
extends from Ashaf in the south to Shershar in the north, is known
as El Kheiran. Date, dom, and deleib palms, as well as limes grow,
and in a few places gardens with onions, shatta (red pepper), rigl,
etc., have been made.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Southern portion.</span>Though the change
is very gradual, south of lat. 13Â° 15â² the plains become more
level. They are broken by deep khors with steep banks, and are
covered with thick bush or tall trees up to the foot of the Nuba
hills. Further south the bush becomes larger, until huge forest
trees are met with. On the edge of the khors there are immense
creepers and tangled undergrowth. The soil appears fertile, but is
only cultivated near the hills. The rest of the country is covered
with jungle, and becomes a swamp in the rains, but afterwards
quickly dries up. The timber found is of little value, being
chiefly acacia. Game is abundant. Elephant, giraffe, and antelope
abound; monkeys and birds are found in great numbers in the woods.
Snakes are also said to be common.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dar Nuba.</span>Dar Nuba is the only part
of Kordofan where the scenery can be said to be pretty, and some of
the views of the hills looking over masses of forest are really
beautiful, whereas most of the rest of the country is wearisome
from its sameness. The hills in the north are nearly bare of
vegetation. On all the Nuba hills thorny bushes grow between the
rocks, except on a few of the more isolated hills, whose summits
consist of piled masses of rock devoid of vegetation. They are
terraced for cultivation, by the people, to a height of 300 or 400
feet from their base.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hills.</span>The most important groups of
hills are, in the north, Jebel Haraza and Jebel Kaja Katul, both
inhabited by Nuba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Arabs, and Jebel Kaja Serrug in the west. In the south, Jebel
Daier, Jebel Tagale, Jebel Kadero, Jebel Gedir, Jebel Moro, Jebel
Talodi, Jebel Kari, Jebel Eliri-liri, and Jebel El Joghub, are all
inhabited by Nubas.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dar Hamar.</span>Dar Hamar, the country
west of Dar Hamid, and extending up to the Darfur frontier,
consists of gently undulating steppes covered with bush. In places
there are a few low rocky hills, and the horizon is broken by huge
tebeldi trees. As there are few wells, almost the whole population
depends on the water that is stored in these trees during the
rains. Throughout the province, from November until June, the
plains have a dried-up appearance, only broken by the few trees,
such as the hashab and marakh, that remain green throughout the
year, and in the southern districts by the trees in the khors,
which can be traced as bands of dark green, winding through the
black hills and dull brown plains.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage system.</span>The drainage
system of Kordofan is complicated. It is doubtful if any rain that
falls there ever reaches the Nile, unless it does so underground.
In the north, the hard sand forms wide shallow wadis, which, after
wandering for a greater or lesser distance, either lose themselves
by spreading over a bare surface, or by striking an outcrop of rock
form a âsink,â which enables shallow wells to be dug, and gives an
excellent supply of water. In the south, the softer soil and more
abundant rainfall, together with, in places, steeper gradients,
cause the shallow wadis of the north to be replaced by narrow khors
with steep sides. But the water eventually disappears from the
surface in the same way as in the northern districts. For example,
the wadi from Abu Tabr and those north of Jebel Derish end at
Shageig, where a plentiful supply of water is to be found all the
year round. Jebel Kajmar also is the natural dam to Wadi El Sigai,
which flows from the south. Habisa is another similar place. In the
south, the Khor Abu Habl loses itself west of Gedid, and further
west, El Sinut, a large lake in the rains, and a swamp afterwards,
is believed to have no outlet.</p>

<p class="cp1">KORDOFAN ARABS WITH CHIEF.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lakes.</span>The chief lakes are Abu
Serai, Sherkeila, El Rahad, and El Birka. In January, 1900, all
were dry, but in 1901, El Rahad lasted for the whole year, though
El Birka was dry by the end of December. Abu Serai always dries up
a few weeks after the rains cease. Sherkeila is said generally to
dry up, but was full in December, 1900, and was expected to last
until the next rains. Rahad was also full.</p>

<p>These lakes are said to be all connected with the Khor Abu Habl,
but native information points to El Rahad being the end of Khor
Khashgil, only Sherkeila and Abu Serai joining the Khor Abu Habl.
As a proof of this, in 1902, after the rains, Sherkeila was full
and El Rahad nearly empty. When dry, wells are dug in the bottom of
the lakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>In Western
Kordofan there is a series of swampsâAbu Zabbat, El Sinut, El
Seneita, Toto, Kutna, and Burdiaâbut though in the rains they are
generally full of water, they dry up almost at once, and can hardly
be dignified with the name of lakes. The Baggara Arabs, who
frequent these swamps, dig wells in the middle of them as they dry
up and build up the mouths with wood and earth to a height of 4 or
5 feet, to prevent the mud and grass washing in during the rains.
In Southern Kordofan there are many such tracts of land under water
during the rains; and Butler Bey (in March, 1902) found, about 50
miles north-west of Jebel Eliri, a lake called El Abiad, which
although said never to dry up, was dry in January, 1903. It was (in
March, 1902) about 6 miles by 4 miles, and contained excellent
fish. As far as could be ascertained it had no outlet. The only
really permanent lake, as far as is known, is Lake Keilak in the
Dar Homr district, which is about 4Â½ miles by 2 miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wadis, &amp;c.</span>In many districts
the difference of level is so slight that it is very difficult,
except during or just after the rains, to detect which way the
water flows. As soon as the country dries up the wind and sand
rapidly obliterates all signs of running water, and many wadis can
only be recognised by their more abundant vegetation.</p>

<p>In the centre of the province, that is, south of the Helba-Bara
road and parts of Dar Hamar and north of the Gedid-Um Ruaba-El
Obeid road, there is no watershed, and hence no khors or wadis
properly so called. This country is undulating, but the hills
seldom have any general direction; where they have, it is north and
south, but the valleys are seldom of any length and never contain
streams. The rain sinks in where it falls. However, just as in Dar
Hamid, every basin, though without an outlet, is called a khor, so
in this part of the country every depression is called a wadi, and
takes its name from the adjacent village.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>The water supply,
which is entirely dependent on the local rains, is derived from (1)
wells; (2) surface water in pools or fulas and the lakes; (3)
tebeldi trees (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>), and melons.</p>

<p>The best watered portions of Kordofan, excluding the Nuba hills,
are Dar Hamid, Bara, and El Eddaiya, where the wells can be worked
with a shaduf, and there is enough water for irrigation, and the
basins of El Obeid, Abu Haraz, and Sherkeila.</p>

<p>Elsewhere water is always liable to give out, and towards the
end of the hot weather whole villages are frequently obliged to
migrate to more favoured places until the rains once more fill the
fulas.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wells.</span>North of 14Â° 13â², except
actually during the rains, when pools form in the khors, the only
water obtainable is from wells or holes in the hills. The former
are numerous, but are liable to become choked by drift sand or to
fall in when a sudden rush of water comes down the khor. They vary
greatly from year to year, being entirely dependent on the local
rainfall over a limited area. There are a few places, such as
Gabra, Habisa and El Safia, where the water is said never to give
out. The wells in the desert country are seldom more than 50 feet,
and often only 5 or 6 feet deep, being dug in the bed of a khor,
often at its termination, as at Kagmar.</p>

<p>On the Bara-El Dueim road some of the wells are, however, over
200 feet deep, and water is generally plentiful. Further south the
wells become less deep, and give less water. In the valley of the
Khor Abu Habl and in Dar El Ahamda the wells average 30 feet, but
the amount of water they contain depends entirely on the local
rains.</p>

<p>The deep wells in Eastern Kordofan are of two kinds: those in
hard soil or rock, and those in sandy soil. The former are
generally 5 to 8 feet in diameter and unlined, and with care will
last for years. The latter are seldom more than 3 or 4 feet in
diameter and require constant attention. As they are dug, a lining
called âlawai,â has to be put in. This is made of grass rope in
lengths of about 40 feet. Near the bottom the lining is made of the
roots of trees, that of the âhashabâ being considered the best for
this purpose. This class of well requires constant repairing and
cleaning, and seldom lasts more than two years, when the sand at
the bottom âcaves in,â and a new well has to be dug. Hence, where
many old wells are found it does not imply that more than one or
two were open at the same time. In these, as in all desert wells, a
dilwa must be used for drawing water, as a bucket damages the
sides. Men must not be allowed to go near the mouth of the well
with boots on. In a few places stone-lined wells exist.</p>

<p>In the Nuba hills the wells are usually big holes, down the
sides of which the women climb to draw water; the art of
well-sinking is generally unknown. In some places, however, the
wells are lined with trunks of trees. When watering cattle the men
and women go down the well standing across it and pass kantushes up
and down. This is a very quick way of drawing water, but, as a good
deal is spilt, and as both men and women are naked and covered with
oil and red clay, the effect on the water is unpleasant. When
drawing water in this way the women protect their head-dress, which
consists as a rule of a lump of clay on each tuft of hair, by
putting half a gourd on their heads.</p>

<p>In the Nuba mountains running streams are occasionally found,
notably at Jebel Eliri, Jebel Tira El Akhdar, and Jebel Kindirma,
but their water almost immediately disappears into the soil on
reaching the plains.</p>

<p>In other mountains water is found in large rock tanks often as
much as 500 feet above the plain.</p>

<p>In the greater portion of Dar Hamar there are no wells, and as
soon as the surface water dries up, generally about the end of
October, the natives are dependent on water-melons and water stored
in tebeldi trees.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fulas.</span>âFulas,â or artificial
ponds, exist near many villages. They are usually made by damming a
khor, but the ground is so porous that the water seldom lasts after
October. The lakes have already been described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Tebeldi trees (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>).</span>The
tebeldi trees (locally termed âHomrâ), which are naturally hollow,
and are besides often artificially scooped out, when used for
storing water have a hole cut in the trunk, generally just above a
big branch, on which a man can stand when drawing water. The hole
is about 18 inches square. Round the bottom of the trunk a small
pool is formed. This catches the water during a storm and it is
then put into the tree by means of leathern buckets (dilwas) or
girbas. Some trees, however, in consequence of being open at the
top and having branches so formed that they act as gutters, fill
themselves; these are called El Lagat, and are naturally very
valuable. The trees vary in diameter outside from 10 to 25 feet,
and the water-holding portion is often 20 feet high. The bark is
frequently much cut about as it is used to make rope and nets. The
largest trees are not used for water as the trunks are generally
cracked. Water so stored remains sweet to the end of the hot
weather, so that good trees are a valuable form of property, and
are let or sold, either with or without the adjacent land. Near a
town they are a source of many quarrels. On the main routes across
Dar Hamar, <em>i.e.</em>, from Obeid to Nahud, or Shidera to Nahud,
the Hamar make a living by selling water to travellers. During the
Dervish rule many of these trees were destroyed by raiding parties
cutting holes at the bottom of the trunk.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Melons.</span>The melons, on which whole
villages, including horses, cattle, etc., depend, are small, almost
tasteless, and full of black seeds. The natives grow them on the
same ground as the dukhn, or else separately. When ripe, they are
gathered and stored in heaps for future use. They are also found
wild all over Dar Hamar. The skins are saved and given to the goats
when the grass dries up. These water melons are not the same as the
ordinary well-known water melon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Produce. Dukhn.</span>Dukhn or millet is
the food of most of the Arabs. It is grown on the sandy ridges
during the rains, and requires little water. It will not grow in
the low ground as there is generally too much salt in the soil. It
is also given to camels and horses, but is considered heating. It
is easily grown. The ground is first cleared of grass. Before the
rains, about May, holes are made with a crooked stick (mach-far) a
few inches deep and 5 or 6 feet apart, and a few grains are dropped
into each hole, which is then closed with the foot. As soon as the
rains commence the grain sprouts, and the crop is gathered at the
end of October or beginning of November. The heads of corn are
piled to dry before threshing. When the young plant is a few inches
high it is liable to attacks from a large millipede called surffa.
The natives make no efforts to kill this, as they say it only eats
at night. This is an error, but even when it is proved to the Arab
that they feed by day he is too lazy to destroy it. Later on the
dukhn is liable, like other crops, to attacks from locusts and
voracious small birds. When required for food, it is ground between
two stones, the lower one being fixed, the upper rubbed backwards
and forwards. Mixed with water it is baked in flat wafers, called
kisra, or boiled into asida. It is also made into a sweet beer
called Merissa or Um Bilbil. The dukhn of Kordofan is famous for
its good quality.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dura.</span>Dura is grown south of El
Obeid, in the valley of the Khor Abu Habl and Nuba hills. It
requires much more water than dukhn. It is cooked in the same way,
and is considered much better food, but does not make such strong
merissa. As forage, it is supposed to be less heating than dukhn,
and being larger, animals are obliged to masticate it more; this is
an advantage, especially in the case of camels.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Simsim.</span>Simsim is grown in small
quantities everywhere. The seed is crushed in primitive mills, made
by hollowing out the stump of a sunt or haraz tree. The pestle has
a long arm attached to it, and is turned round by a camel or a
bullock. The oil is used for cooking and hair-dressing. The refuse
is excellent food for animals out of condition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tobacco.</span>Tobacco is grown in small
quantities in the Nuba hills. It is wetted and made into hard cakes
and smoked in large pipes by the blacks. It has a singularly
unpleasant flavour.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cotton.</span>Cotton is grown in many
parts of the Province and must have been formerly extensively
cultivated, as the old plants are to be seen in the vicinity of
most ruined villages. It is woven on hand looms into damur (coarse
cotton cloth) of an inferior quality.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Salt.</span>Salt is made in two ways. One
method consists in mixing earth that contains salt with water,
allowing the sediment to settle, and then evaporating or boiling
away the water. The other method, which is followed at El Ghar, and
other places where there are salt-water wells, is simply to boil
the water until it has all evaporated. It is generally of a dark
colour and somewhat bitter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Iron.</span>Iron is plentiful, but now
seldom worked. Some is smelted at El Nahud and Um Semeina, and
spear heads, hoes, and axes are made. The works at Jebel Haraza are
not now used. The absence of fuel will always preclude its becoming
an extensive industry. A clay full of iron is found some 60 miles
to the north-west of El Obeid.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Other minerals.</span>Some old workings
of gold and other minerals in the Tagale country have recently been
explored, but the result has been unsatisfactory, and the gold
appears to have been worked out. There may be other minerals in the
country, but no details are known regarding them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gum.</span>The best gum comes from the
grey acacia, called hashab. This is found between the parallels of
13Â° and 14Â°, but is little worked west of El Obeid, on account of
the cost of carriage to Khartoum. The chief places where it is
collected are El Obeid, Taiara, Bint Joda, Gedid, Um Dam, and
Nahud, whence it is either taken by camel straight to Khartoum or
to the river at El Dueim or Goz Abu Guma, and there put into boats.
The cultivation is simple.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_177">[177]</span> In January strips of bark are torn off the
trees, dead branches cut away, and, in well managed gardens, the
grass is cut as protection from fire. This should always be done,
as fires, both accidental and incendiary, are by no means uncommon.
As soon as the hot weather comes on, the sap runs up the tree and
oozes out of the wound and the tree comes into leaf. This âgardenâ
(geneina) gum is collected every few days and taken into the
nearest market. As soon as the rains commence the flow of gum
ceases. Wild gum (wadi) is also collected by people who do not own
gardens, from the ownerless and, as it were, wild trees, but it is
worth comparatively little.</p>

<p>The forests south of the Khor Abu Habl are full of red gum
acacias (talh), but the trees are not worked, as the gum is of
little value compared with the hashab which abounds. The latter is
not yet worked to more than half its capacity, even in Eastern
Kordofan.</p>

<p>The following table shows the amount of gum, in hundredweights,
exported from the Sudan, most of which comes from Kordofan, but it
is impossible to say exactly what proportion:â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ostrich feathers.</span>The chief market
for ostrich feathers is at El Nahud, where considerable quantities
are collected. The best come from Dar El Zeiah in Northern Darfur,
but few of these come into the market. The Hamar Arabs keep a few
birds in pens. Ostriches have been seen within a few miles of El
Obeid. Ostrich farming on a large scale has been proposed, but
would be difficult on account of the expense of obtaining food.
Feathers from wild birds (Kitala) are longer and more valuable than
those plucked from farm birds (Maata), which, though cleaner, are
shorter and cheaper.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ivory.</span>The trade in ivory was never
very large, and had in 1901 practically ceased. It is now, however,
increasing rapidly, owing to Government restrictions being removed.
Over 50,000 lbs. weight passed through Nahud in 1903.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">India-rubber.</span>Large quantities of
india-rubber might be collected from the country south of El
Eddaiya if the cost of transport to Khartoum admitted of a fair
price being paid for its collection. At present it does not.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle.</span>There is a large export of
cattle, mostly to Omdurman.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imports.</span>The imports consist
chiefly of cotton goods, sugar, salt, soap, tobacco, beads and
metal goods, such as axes, hoes, and fasses. Blue and white cottons
and muslins, with open-work pattern, are chiefly in demand, but
coloured goods are frequently asked for now that the sartorial
regulations of the Khalifa are no longer in force. The blacks
especially like striking colours, but the dyes must be fast to
stand washing with mud and water when no soap is available.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Past and present conditions.</span>It
must be borne in mind in comparing the following account with
former ones, that the Khalifa laid practically the whole of
Kordofan waste at various times, and that when the province was
re-occupied in December, 1899, all the large towns and most of the
villages had ceased to exist. Thus, on the old road to El Obeid
from Tura, <em>viÃ¢</em> Abu Shok and Khursi not a single village or
well remained, and the present road from El Dueim to Helba and Bara
had to be taken. Bara was found almost deserted, all the old houses
and gardens having been destroyed. Khursi, once a large place with
a market, had no inhabitants, and has now only a few huts. At El
Obeid there was not a single soul, and nothing was left of the old
city but a portion of the mudiria buildings. Melbis is quite
overgrown, and Abu Haraz is still in ruins. Between El Obeid and
Taiara there are now six villages. In January, 1900, there was not
one. At Foga, once the headquarters of troops and a telegraph
station, the ruins can hardly be traced. At many places in Dar
Hamid, hundreds of date palms had been cut down. Everywhere the
destruction was wanton and complete.</p>

<p>The only people who successfully resisted the Dervish occupation
were the Nubas; living in the hills, they closed the entrances to
their villages with defensible walls. They were constantly raided
by slave-traders in the old days and so knew how best to defend
themselves. But although the Mahdi failed to force these hills,
except in the case of a few small and detached ones, the
inhabitants all suffered severely, especially from slave-raiding.
Mek Geili said in 1900 that he had lost two-thirds of his people,
and, judging by the number of deserted houses in his country, this
statement is probably not much exaggerated.</p>

<p>Those Arabs who were not taken to Omdurman, and who rebelled
against the Khalifa in 1896, fled after Mahmudâs<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> raids to the Nuba hills, the
Gezira, or Nahud, a place which, though never mentioned by old
travellers, had over 4,000 inhabitants in March, 1900, and a large
market with traders from the Bahr El Ghazal, Darfur, and Wadai.
Many of these people have now returned to their villages, but they
are, of course, greatly impoverished and reduced in numbers.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c08s1b"></a>2. <em>Inhabitants.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>The inhabitants consist of
Arabs in the plains and Nubas (or blacks) in the hills. The Arabs
are either villagers or nomads; the latter being divided into camel
owners (Siat El Ilbil) and cattle owners (Baggara). There are no
camel owners south and no Baggara north of El Obeid; in the south
they are horse and cattle owners.</p>

<p>Nearly all the nomads grow a crop of dukhn, and in the west,
where there are no wells, melons are grown for the cattle during
the dry season. Portions of these nomad tribes have been obliged to
become sedentary in consequence of the destruction of their
herds.</p>

<p class="cp1">TAAISHA (BAGGARA) GIRL.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villagers.</span>The village Arabs own
small herds of sheep and goats, a few donkeys, and some cattle, and
sometimes a camel or two. Near the river they cultivate the islands
and low ground, growing dura, beans, onions, etc. Inland, dukhn,
simsim, and melons form the chief crops, with a little cotton in
places. Throughout Eastern Kordofan gum is collected largely and
exchanged for dura or cotton goods.</p>

<p>Very poor after the defeat of the Khalifa, in consequence of two
good years, they are now becoming fairly prosperous. A large area
round each hella (village) is under cultivation; in the gum
country, the gardens show signs of attention, and both the men and
women, instead of wearing the dirty waist-cloth seen when the
province was first occupied, now wear Manchester cotton goods very
largely. Silver ornaments are becoming common.</p>

<p>They have few firearms, and, as a rule, only carry a spear or
small axe, even when travelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>The most
important tribe is the <span class="sc">Gowama</span>, living
between El Obeid and El Agaba, and owning most of the gum country.
The Shankab and Mesellemia live on the river; the <span class=
"sc">Dar Hamid</span> tribes and the <span class=
"sc">Bederia</span>, near El Obeid, are large tribes, but are now
poor. There are several villages of <span class="sc">Danagla</span>
and <span class="sc">Jaalin</span> scattered about. Jebel Atshan
and Jebel Royan are inhabited by <span class="sc">Zaghawa</span>
Arabs, relations of the large tribe in Northern Darfur, and at
Ushut, north-west of El Obeid, there are a few <span class=
"sc">Nimr</span> from Eastern Darfur. Between Hashaba and Jebel Kon
the <span class="sc">Baza</span> Arabs have many gardens, and near
Yasin, half-way between Jebel Kon and Taiara, the <span class=
"sc">Massadab</span> have a few villages.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nomads. Baggara.</span>The nomad tribes
are far superior to the villagers, both physically and mentally.
The various <span class="sc">Baggara</span><a id=
"FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a> tribes live chiefly in Southern Kordofan, and
only move north during the rains. They occupy the plains between El
Obeid and the Bahr El Arab, and, being constantly in touch with the
<span class="sc">Nubas</span> in the hills, were the chief
slave-raiders. Their occupations are hunting for meat and skins,
and occasionally for ivory, and herding their cattle. They own a
good many horses, but when on the move carry their baggage on their
bulls. They always carry arms. These consist of a large stabbing
spear and small throwing spears. They own a certain number of
Remington rifles, but have little ammunition, and their rifles are
generally in bad order, as they cut down the stock and fore-end to
lighten them and frequently remove the backsight, as it makes the
rifle more convenient to carry.</p>

<p>They also carry a broad-bladed straight sword, which, when
mounted, is slung over the high pommel of the saddle, the blade
resting against the side of the saddle under the left thigh. The
large spear (Kibis) is carried in the hand and the small spears
(Tabaiig) are hung on the off side in a kind of quiver (Turkash).
Shields are not used. A few of the richer men wear chain armour.
They are by far the most warlike people in Kordofan, and are
inclined to resent being no longer allowed to raid the blacks. The
most important tribes are the <span class="sc">Hawazma</span>,
between Sungikai and Jebel Eliri; the <span class=
"sc">Messeria</span>, near Sinut; the <span class=
"sc">Kenana</span>, between Lake No and Tendik; the Selim, on the
White Nile south of Dar El Ahamda (a branch of the tribe situated
in the Gezira and Upper Nile Provinces), the <span class=
"sc">Habbania</span>, now a small tribe at Sherkeila. The
<span class="sc">Homr</span>, south of El Eddaiya towards the Bahr
El Arab, are a large and fairly rich tribe; and the <span class=
"sc">Gimma</span>, near Gedid, the majority of whom, however, have
permanent villages.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Camel owners.</span>The camel owners
(Siat El Ilbil) are less numerous, and live entirely in Northern
Kordofan, only moving as far south as El Obeid when the water and
grazing further north is exhausted. This depends, of course, on the
rains. In the winter of 1902-03 the Kordofan tribes were all south
of the Shageig-Kagmar road by the beginning of December. They are
by far the pleasantest-mannered Arabs to meet, being independent,
but hospitable and polite, though perhaps no more honest than the
rest.</p>

<p>They live chiefly on camel or goatsâ milk (the former is
excellent) and dukhn; the latter they grow as a rain crop or buy
with money earned by carrying goods, or else in exchange for sheep
and goats. During the rains they all go north and east towards
Dongola and beyond the Wadi Melh. Though most of the tribes still
own herds of camels, goats, and sheep, large portions of some
tribes live in villages and cultivate.</p>

<p>Of the camel-owning tribes in the province, the <span class=
"sc">Hamar</span>, once a large and prosperous tribe owning
thousands of camels, now reduced in numbers, own but a few hundred.
They have a good many sheep and goats. Their country (Dar Hamar)
lies between Dar Hamid and the Darfur frontier. A large proportion
of this tribe have now settled down in their former villages and
cultivate near Nahud, Um Bel, and all along the frontier between
Foga and Taweisha.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Kababish</span> still own many camels. They
claim the country north of Kaja Katul and eastwards to Gabra.<a id=
"FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a> Their great watering-places are Gabra, El
Safia, Habisa, and Kagmar. A great part of the tribe under Sheikh
Ali Tom suffered very heavily from the Dervish rule, and for having
supplied us with camels in 1884-85, they had to face the vengeance
of the Mahdi when we abandoned the country. Their cultivation is
west of Omdurman.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Shenabla</span> graze their flocks and
herds in Dar Hamid, but keep many goats and sheep near Shat. The
<span class="sc">Beni Jerar</span>, now a small tribe, generally
water their camels at Kagmar, but have cultivation near Shat, Um
Deisis, and in the Busata district. Both the <span class=
"sc">Shenabla</span> and <span class="sc">Beni Jerar</span> were
formerly under the head sheikh of the Kababish, but separated in
Dervish times.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Kawahla</span> live north-west of Shageig,
where they water during the dry season. They own many camels and do
a good deal of carrying trade.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Blacks.</span>In the northern hills the
inhabitants called <span class="sc">Nuba Arabs</span> speak Arabic
and have copied the habits of the village Arabs. They are black and
have woolly hair but their features are more prominent than is the
case with the southern tribes: they are not negroes. They live
chiefly in straw tukls at the foot of their hills, though at Jebel
Haraza some still live on the hillside. At Jebel Um Durrug the
ruins of a very large village can be seen on the north side of
Jebel Kershungal (the highest peak), near the largest well (a crack
in the rock). At Jebel Abu Hadid there is also a large<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> ruined village on the side of
Jebel El Hella. At Jebel Atshan and Jebel Maganus, now entirely
deserted by the Nubas, the ruins of small circular stone huts can
be traced.</p>

<p>In the southern hills, as at Jebel Tagale, Jebel Daier, Jebel El
Joghub, etc., the natives are pure, or nearly pure, <span class=
"sc">Nubas</span>, and speak Nuba, though most hills have different
dialects. But there are also several hills occupied by escaped
slaves. These consist of negroes of mixed origin, and call
themselves after the tribe they escaped from. Thus at Jebel Eliri
there are <span class="sc">Hawazmas</span> and <span class=
"sc">Kawahlas</span>; at Jebel Krondi, <span class=
"sc">Hawazmas</span>; and at Jebel Talodi, <span class=
"sc">Homrs</span>. They speak Arabic, and have little intercourse
with the <span class="sc">Nubas</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Nubas</span> are split up into innumerable
tribes, each under a mek, who is generally on bad terms with his
neighbours. Mek Geili, of Tagale, is one of the most powerful. He
is a Jaalin by extraction; it is not uncommon for the mek to be of
Arab descent. Each mek is assisted by a âkugur.â who acts as chief
rain-maker and adviser to the tribe, his power being dependent
chiefly on his astuteness. He is often the only man who can speak
any Arabic.</p>

<p>Living in the zone of good rains they raise large crops of dura
round the base of their hills. They make, in good years, large
quantities of merissa (native beer), and drunkenness is very
common. They own a good many cattle. The men, as a rule, wear no
clothing, and the young women are usually contented with an
elaborately plaited head of hair and a girdle of beads, from which
a strip of cotton 3 or 4 inches wide depends, both in front and
behind. But in places the latter garment is replaced by a strip of
dom palm an inch wide. The married women generally wear either a
cotton robe or a goat or sheep-skin. In many places the whole body
is covered with a mixture of red clay and oil; and each tuft of
hair, which is generally very short, is covered with a lump of red
clay to make it stand out at right angles to the head. Cotton
clothes, are, however, gradually coming into fashion in the less
remote hills.</p>

<p>In most of the hills there are a good many rifles, but
ammunition is scarce. The Remington rifle is the most common, but
old Italian ones, magazine and single-loaders, are seen. Ammunition
is manufactured locally, match-heads being often used as a
substitute for caps.</p>

<p>A man who owns a rifle, even if his bandolier be empty, always
carries it for appearance sake. In January, 1900, it was estimated
that Mek Geili alone had 1,500 rifles. The other arms carried are
knob-kerries and spears, but no shields. The blacks chiefly fear
being raided by horsemen when they are cutting their crops on the
plains at the foot of their hills. To disconcert the Arab horsemen
they leave the trunks of the trees about 2 or 3 feet high when they
clear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> ground,
and also make pit-falls with spikes at the bottom. A horse running
against one of these stumps hidden in the dura gives his rider a
bad fall and enables the fleeing black to turn on his pursuer or
escape to the hills. Their houses used to be always built high up
on the hill, and any gullies or valleys closed by stone walls high
enough and strong enough to be easily defended, but now they are
beginning to build in the plains. They also take care, as a rule,
to have water inside their defences; they were thus able to hold
out successfully against the Dervish expeditions which were sent
against them from time to time. It is also probable that having
been constantly raided for slaves by the Government troops they had
discovered the best means of escape and of defence even before the
Mahdia.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say how they will develop now that they no
longer live in fear of the Arab. They are lazy, but have had no
inducements to work. Easily angered, their quarrels do not seem to
last long; in fact, they are primitive children who require
constant watching lest they become unmanageable, and constant
protection lest other races abuse their ignorance, improvidence, or
credulity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Habitations.</span>In a few places, such
as El Dueim and El Obeid, there are mud houses with flat roofs. But
the natives mostly live in conical-shaped straw huts (tukls) or in
box-shaped shelters called ârakubas.â The house is generally
surrounded by a thorn fence, inside which the sheep and goats are
kept at night.</p>

<p>Tukls are cylindrical buildings with conical roofs. They are
generally built by driving forked stakes (shab) into the ground in
a circle from 10 to 20 feet in diameter. A circle (kara) of similar
size is then made, apart from the other circle, of strong tough
twigs tied together every few inches with strips of bark. To form
the roof, four poles are tied together at their small ends and the
butts pushed into the kara to form a cone. A small circle of twigs
is then lashed on near the top and more poles placed with their
butts in the kara and their tops lashed to the upper circle. As
many more horizontal bands of twigs as the size of the huts demand
are then made, and the whole frame is lifted on to the forks of the
uprights. The roof is then thatched with dura, or dukhn stalks, and
the walls are built of the same material.</p>

<p>âRakubasâ are box-shaped huts made of poles and covered with
grass or straw. They are useless in the rains but excellent at
other times, as the walls, while keeping out the sun, let the wind
through.</p>

<p>The camel-owning Arabs make tents of woollen blankets. They are
exactly the shape of gipsy tents in England. The Baggara tribes
make similar tents, but cover them with mats made of grass or reeds
and tanned ox-hides called âdilla.â The old frames can frequently
be seen on deserted camping grounds.</p>

<p>The Nubas, though they vary very much in skill, generally build
better tukls than the Arabs. The walls are made of either stone,
mud, or wattle and daub, the latter being sometimes ornamented with
a pattern in red clay. The roofs are much better thatched than
those of the Arabs and are given a steeper pitch.</p>

<p>The furniture of an Arab tukl consists of a few bedsteads
(angarib), very short and narrow, and sometimes a mat. The cooking
utensils consist of a grindstone (generally outside the door), a
stone to cook kisra on, a few wooden dishes for food, some flat
baskets and earthenware pots (kantÃ»sh), spherical in shape, for
water. Pillows of wood to support the head are used by the blacks,
who go in for extensive head dresses. Small and very light axes are
used for cutting wood, they are seldom more than an inch wide and 5
inches long. A dilwa or bucket made of a piece of soft leather
suspended from a circle of wood by strings a few inches long, so
that it can open out nearly flat at the bottom of the well when
water is scarce, is used for drawing water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rope.</span>Rope is made from the bark of
trees, such as the tebeldi (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>), sayal
(<i>Acacia spirocarpa</i>), kittr, and usher, which makes the
best.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fire.</span>Fire is made by twirling a
stick of marakh (<i>Leptadenia spartium</i>) on a piece of usher
(<i>Calotropis procera</i>), or if no usher is available, two
pieces of marakh are used. Two pieces of hard wood are also used at
times, sand being put in the hole to increase friction.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c08s1c"></a>3. <em>Towns.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sc">El Obeid</span>.âEl Obeid, the capital of
Kordofan, is situated in lat. 13Â° 11â² north and long. 30Â° 14â² east.
Its elevation has been given as between 1,700 and 2,000 feet. It is
built on the side of a depression in the centre of which are the
wells. These are from 60 to 80 feet deep, and give (except from
March to June) a plentiful supply of water for the present
population of about 10,000 people, but in former times, when the
population was larger, there were frequently water famines.</p>

<p>The old mudiria is still standing and has been repaired.
Barracks for a Sudanese battalion and details are being built, and
the town laid out in squares. Most of the inhabitants, many of whom
only come in for the dry season, live in tukls, but a good many
mud-brick houses have been built by merchants. There is a large
market, and a considerable trade is done in gum and cattle.</p>

<p>The old fortifications can still be traced in places, but most
of the old buildings have disappeared.</p>

<p>The town was held by Mohammed Pasha Said against the Mahdi from
3rd September, 1882, till 17th January, 1883,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_182">[182]</span> when it fell (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_247">p. 247</a>). It is 158 miles from Dueim on the W. Nile
and, therefore, 268 miles from Khartoum. It is 388 miles from El
Fasher.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bara</span>.âBara is now a small place, but
there are excellent gardens there and a small market.</p>

<p><span class="sc">El Dueim</span>.âEl Dueim, on the Nile, is the
port of Kordofan. Most of the merchandise for the interior is
landed there, and gum is shipped to Omdurman. There is a good
market. (<em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a> for
description.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Nahud</span>.âNahud, situated 165 miles west of
El Obeid and 80 miles south of Foga, is a new town of some 7,000
inhabitants. It is not mentioned in any of the old accounts of
Kordofan, as before the decline of the Dervish rule it was a small
place populated by Hamar and people from the river, such as Jaalin,
Danagla, etc., who had originally gone out to trade in slaves.
Gradually people collected there, so that the inhabitants consist
of every tribe in Kordofan, the Hamar predominating. All the trade
with Darfur passes through here, and there is a large market where
cotton and trade goods can be purchased. Cattle is the chief trade.
Gum is not in any demand, owing to cost of transport. Feathers and
ivory are obtainable in fairly large quantities. India-rubber is
brought in in small quantities. There is little crime there now;
the market has been built, and there are some 40 good mud-brick
shops owned by Greeks, Syrians, Jaalin, Danagla, etc. Dukhn is
plentiful. When the town was first occupied drunkenness was very
common amongst both sexes. Dura, simsim, and cotton are also
brought into the market. It is the second town in Kordofan, and is
increasing.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Taiara</span>.âTaiara, formerly the centre of
the gum trade, was destroyed by the Dervishes, and in December,
1899, consisted of but six huts. It is now the headquarters of a
district and has a good market. There are several gum merchants
there, besides agents of Omdurman firms. The place is rapidly
growing.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c08s1d"></a>4. <em>Animals.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle.</span>The Baggara tribes have
large herds of the hump variety, but they are seldom anxious to
sell them. They are small, but their meat is of good quality. The
bulls are used as pack-transport animals and are extremely docile.
Cattle are generally watered every second day, but if grazing is
scarce and they have to go far from the wells, it is not uncommon
for them to go three or even four days without water. This applies
especially to the cattle in Northern Kordofan. There is also a
smaller humpless variety.</p>

<p>The Nubas own considerable herds but seldom sell them. Like the
Dinkas and other blacks they regard cattle as a form of wealth
which enables them to obtain wives.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Camels.</span>These have also decreased
to a terrible extent. The Kababish, Kawahla, Shanabla, Hamar, and
Beni Jerar, who formerly had the whole of the carrying trade of
Kordofan, are now hardly able to cope with it. All over the gum
country Hawawir and other northern tribesmen are to be found with
caravans of camels. The Hamar have almost ceased to be a
camel-owning tribe, and it must be years before the supply of
camels is at all large. The villagers own few camels, and the
Baggara tribes none, as they cannot live south of lat. 13Â° 30â². In
the Dinka country to the south it is not at all uncommon for
people, especially children, to fly in dread at the sight of a
camel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Horses.</span>The Baggara tribes own a
good many horses. Some are ugly animals, all head and tail, and not
up to much weight, but the larger proportion are small horses, up
to weight, good looking and well bred. The Dongalawi horse is
prized, but it is now scarce; horses, or rather ponies, are also
imported from Abyssinia. These are far inferior, but ridden by
Arabs they are more suited to the country, being very hardy. If
trained they can do 60 miles without water and do not seem to
suffer. Their price is generally Â£E.3 to Â£E.5, but a good one runs
to Â£E.18.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Donkeys.</span>There are a good many
donkeys, chiefly among the villagers. Like the horses they can go
for a couple of days without water. From Zereiga to Bint Joda (50
miles) or from Abu Zabbat to Nahud (65 miles) are quite common
marches for donkeys.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sheep and goats.</span>Large numbers of
sheep and goats are owned by all tribes. In the south there is a
small and very active breed which seems to carry more meat in
proportion to its size than the ordinary Arab breed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>Elephants are found in Dar El
Homr, Dar El Ahamda, Dar El Tagale, and Dar Jange. Elephants are
very numerous in Dar El Homr from May until June, when they travel
to Dar Fertit and towards Lake No.</p>

<p>Rhinoceros (both black and âwhiteâ) are found in Dar El Homr and
Dar El Rizeigat.</p>

<p>Buffalo are found in Dar El Homr, Dar El Nuba and in Dar El
Ahamda.</p>

<p>Lion, leopard, and cheetah are found all over Kordofan from
south of Kaja Katul, and are very numerous in the south.</p>

<p>Giraffe are found south of El Eddaiya and are very plentiful all
over Southern and South-Western Kordofan.</p>

<p>Roan-antelope are found in Southern Kordofan.</p>

<p>Kudu are found scattered all over Kordofan; most plentiful in
Kaja and Talodi districts.</p>

<p>Hartebeeste (<i>Jacksonii</i>) are very plentiful in Southern
Kordofan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Tiang are
plentiful in S. and S.E. and in Kaja and Foga districts; there is a
different species to that found on the White Nile, etc., which has
been identified as the â<i>Damaliscus korrigum</i>â of West Africa,
<em>vide</em> <a href="#appc">App. C.</a></p>

<p>Oryx (white) are found in Dar Hamid and Kaja districts.</p>

<p>Ril or Addra Gazelle are found all over Northern and
North-Western Kordofan, but are local. They are not found elsewhere
in the Sudan.</p>

<p>Addax are found north of Jebel Fas. Rare.</p>

<p>Ariel are found near Gabra and as far south as Fachi Shoya, but
not very far west of White Nile.</p>

<p>White-eared cob (<i>Cobus leucotis</i>) are found on the White
Nile and in Dar Jange.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grayâs waterbuck are found in Dar Jange.</p>

<p>Waterbuck (two kinds) are found on the White Nile and in Dar
Homr.</p>

<p>Reedbuck are found in Southern Kordofan.</p>

<p>Oribi, duiker, dig-dig, bushbuck, gazelle (four kinds) and
warthog are found in most places south and south-west of
Keilak.</p>

<p>Gazelle (three kinds), viz., <i>Rufifrons</i>, <i>Dorcas</i>,
and <i>Isabella</i>, are plentiful in various part of Kordofan.</p>

<p>The âharnessed antelopeâ and eland are said to exist in the
south.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Small Game.</span>Hares, quail,
partridge, jungle-fowl, bustard (four kinds), and guinea-fowl are
plentiful in the south up to January.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c08s1e"></a>5. <em>Climate and Health.</em></h4>

<p>The year in Kordofan is divided into three seasons, viz.:â</p>

<p>The Kharif, or rainy season, which commences usually about 15th
of June and lasts until the end of September.</p>

<p>The Shita, or cold weather, from the beginning of October to the
end of February.</p>

<p>The Seif, or hot weather, from March to the middle of June.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Rainy Season</span>.<a id=
"FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a>âTowards the middle of June the wind changes to
the south, and heavy clouds begin to collect in that quarter.
These, in a very few days, bring a storm of rain, usually heralded
by strong wind, clouds of dust and sand, and thunder and lightning.
These storms appear every two or three days. Although a steady rain
falls, occasionally for 24 days, it usually comes in the form of
stormy showers. As the result of these showers, by the end of July,
the ground, even in the villages and around Government buildings,
become covered with rank green vegetation, which defies all efforts
to destroy it. The rank smell from this grass, the numerous frogs,
toads, and other reptiles it harbours, and the general lassitude
produced by these surroundings, render life anything but enjoyable
during the day, whilst sleep inside oneâs house is rendered well
nigh impossible at night by the steamy moistures of the air and
attacks of sand flies and mosquitos.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Cold Weather</span>.âTowards the end of
September the wind begins to blow from the north and a great change
takes place. The fever decreases, until by the end of November
there are only a few cases in hospital. The weather is delightfully
cool and the breezes bracing and refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Hot Weather</span>.âThe heat in El Obeid
and Western Kordofan is not as great as in other parts of the
Sudan; the maximum temperature being rarely above 106Â° Fahr.,
whilst the nights remain delightfully cool until the rains
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Health.</span>Most diseases in Kordofan may be included
under one of two headsâmalarial and venereal. Were it not for these
classes of disease Kordofan might be considered a healthy
country.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Malaria</span>.âThe fever is, perhaps, more
often of the remittent type. Those attacked for the first time
almost invariably have remittent fever; the subsequent attacks are
either remittent or intermittent. During January and February,
which are otherwise healthy months, a particularly sudden and
severe type of remittent fever has been noticed. A patient,
previously well, will lose consciousness in the course of an hour,
and either die in a state of coma or only recover after weeks of
convalescence. This apparently is the result of malaria contracted
during the rains, as Egyptian and British officers who have spent a
wet season here and afterwards left the district, have been
attacked in this way whilst on leave in Cairo and England. The good
effect of hypodermic injections of hydro-bromide of quinine in
fever of this kind is worth recording.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Venereal Diseases</span> of every kind rage,
except in Dar Nuba, where the people make great efforts to prevent
the spread of these diseases. Travellers should take precautions to
prevent their guides and servants drinking out of their
water-bottles.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Water-borne Diseases</span>.âOf diseases
traceable to an impure water supply there has been a remarkable
freedom in El Obeid itself. In this garrison there have been only a
few cases of dysentery and diarrhÅa during the last three years.
Amongst the inhabitants of the country further south, who derive
their water supply from rain water collected in hollows during the
rainy season or from shallow wells during the dry season, this is
not always the case, as many cases of dysentery, tape worm, guinea
worm (very prevalent), etc., coming from these parts testify.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Guinea Worm</span>.âWith regard to the guinea
worm, there is not sufficient evidence to prove that it is
contracted by washing or wading in water, as the natives state. It
in all probability is taken into the system with drinking water. To
avoid this pest all surface water or water that is likely to have
been fouled by the natives wading in it (for the ova are introduced
into the water in this way) should be boiled before being
drunk.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Small-Pox</span> is still common in the
southern part of the district, and the faces of many of the
inhabitants are scarred in consequence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pneumonia</span> is common amongst the blacks
during the cold weather, and a great many camels die from this
disease.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c08s2"></a><span class="sc">Section
2.âDarfur</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Historical.<a id=
"FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a></span>Darfur was formerly one of the line of
ancient African Kingdoms stretching across the Continent from west
to east, of which Wadai and Abyssinia are the only ones still
surviving<a id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> as independent states. Up to the early part of
the 18th century the Kings of Darfur had dominion over the country
as far east as the Atbara; but the war-like Fungs, who at that time
were one of the most powerful tribes of the Sudan, gradually drove
the Darfurians back, and established their own authority on the
banks of the White Nile. <em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_229">p.
229.</a></p>

<p>In 1770 they wrested the Province of Kordofan from the Darfur
kings, but five years later it was retaken by the latter, and
remained under their control until conquered in 1822 by Mohammed
Bey Dafterdar, the brother-in-law of Ismail Pasha, who was burnt at
Shendi.</p>

<p>After the loss of Kordofan the Darfurians retired westwards and
the kings then governed only a circumscribed area, of which Jebel
Marra was the centre. This is the Darfur that was conquered and
annexed to Egypt by Zubeir Pasha in 1874 and which is the Darfur of
the present day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Present boundaries.</span>Modern Darfur
in shape is a more or less regular parallelogram, 400 miles by 400
miles, and may be said to lie between N. Lat. 10Â° and 16Â° and E.
Long. 22Â° and 27Â° 30â².</p>

<p>It is bounded on the north by Dar Bedaiat and the desert west of
the Wadi Melh; on the east by Kordofan,<a id=
"FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a> the frontier running from Kaja Serrug (Darfur)
in a south-west direction to Dam Jamad (Kordofan) and thence in a
southerly direction to the Bahr El Arab and Dar Fertit; Dar
Habbania and Dar Taaisha belonging to Darfur. The western boundary
leaves Dar Sula and Borgu or Wadai within the French sphere of
influence and Dar Gimr and Dar Tama to Darfur.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Drainage.</span>The watershed of Darfur,
which forms part of that separating the basin of Lake Chad from
that of the Nile, runs nearly north and south through the centre of
the country. The chief features which define it are in the North
Jebel Meidob (3,500 feet) connected with Jebel Tagabo further south
by a plateau, the greatest altitude of which is about 1,200 feet,
and further south Jebel Marra and its offshoots. To the south-west
of these mountains, the main peaks of which rise to an altitude of
some 6,000 feet, the plain is about 4,000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>As might be
expected the general direction of the drainage is east and west. In
the north the country is so arid and the rains so meagre that the
water draining eastwards towards the Wadi Melh soon sinks into the
sandy soil and disappears. Similarly, further south the Wadis,
chief of which is Wadi Ko, draining the east and south-east of the
Marra group and which flow generally in a south-easterly direction
towards the Bahr El Arab, an affluent of the Bahr El Ghazal, seldom
if ever discharge water into that river. The Wadis Bulbul, Gendi,
and Ibra, however, which spring from the more southern slopes of
the watershed and also trend south-east, are believed to convey a
considerable quantity of water into the Bahr El Arab during the
rainy season.</p>

<p>To the west of the watershed the general trend of the wadis is
south-west, the Wadi Sonot and Kia in the north, with their
affluents draining the hills of Dar Tama, and most important of all
the Wadi Azum which carries the drainage from the western slopes of
Jebel Marra are thought to unite near Dar Sula and to flow, under
the name of Bahr El Salamat, towards Lake Iro, though it is
doubtful if their waters ever reach this marshy swamp which, in
turn, drains into the Shari.</p>

<p>The drainage of the south-west of Darfur flows towards the River
Mamun, a perennial stream, also an affluent of the Shari, which, of
course, empties into the southern end of Lake Chad.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water supply.</span>Broadly it may be
said that the country to the north and east of the Marra range
resembles that of Kordofan in its character and usual dearth of
water, whilst to the west, south-west, and south it is much better
watered and more fertile. During the rains water is here everywhere
plentiful, whilst at this season much of Southern Darfur becomes
marshy and difficult to travel over. In the rainy season too the
principal wadis, especially those in the south and south-west, are
perfect torrents, and, although their beds are dry soon after the
cessation of the rains, water is generally to be found in abundance
held up by the clayey strata at a few feet below the surface. In
Eastern Darfur the wells are of considerable depth and at great
distances from each other, especially south of Dara and Taweisha,
and the people are dependent to a great extent on water melons
(<em>batikh</em>) and to a less extent on Tebeldi trees
(<i>Adansonia digitata</i>) which are such a feature of Dar Hamar,
the adjoining district of Kordofan.</p>

<p>The deepest wells are at Karnak, where water is only obtained at
250 feet. At Burush on the Fasher-Obeid road and on the road to
Taweisha, and at Taweisha itself, the wells, which pass through
strata of chalk and marl, average from 100 to 130 feet in
depth.</p>

<p>At El Fasher the wells are of no great depth and at the end of
the dry season water is obtainable at 35 feet.</p>

<p>The nearer one approaches the central group of mountains the
depth at which water is found diminishes. At 3,200 feet above the
sea it is found by excavating in the sandy beds of khors, but at
4,000 feet there is running water which becomes more abundant still
further to the west of Jebel Marra.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Geology.</span>The geological formation
is very varied; in the west the mountains show a volcanic origin;
in the north and south granite and sandstone are the prevailing
rocks; in the east the soil is sandy and contains a quantity of
iron, which is worked to a small extent.</p>

<p>In the east and north-east, granite predominates, with the
exception of a strip between Foga and El Fasher, where red and
white sandstone crops out.</p>

<p>In the north, Wadi Melit and the hills in its neighbourhood are
of gneiss. To the north-east of this, granite again predominates at
Saya, whilst still further north, Jebel Tagabo is of sandstone.</p>

<p>Jebel Meidob contains both sandstone and granite; this group has
been much distorted by volcanic agency, and beds of lava are to be
seen in all directions. To its south-west lies Bir El Melh,<a id=
"FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a> an extinct crater, which to outward appearance
is an insignificant hill, but has a depth of about 150 feet. Here
is a small lake strongly impregnated with alkaline matter, while
sweet water springs issue from the sandstone and granite
declivities.</p>

<p>The Jebel Marra group is also of volcanic origin; lava and
granite are to be found everywhere, but there is no sandstone;
small peaks of pink granite crop up here and there between these
mountains and El Fasher.</p>

<p>Stretching from the main group in a westerly direction for a
distance of 30 or 40 miles is a huge dyke of white quartz with a
sandstone plateau raised some 300 feet above the plain which is
itself about 3,200 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>The inhabitants report a large lake of brackish water, from
which salt can be obtained, on the north-eastern part of the
mountain; while, at a dayâs journey to the west, salt is also found
at Karunga, and the Wadi Burka is strongly impregnated with
soda.</p>

<p>In all the depressions sand rich in iron is met with.</p>

<p>In a southerly direction from Jebel Marra, there stretches a
broad alluvial plain which is dotted all over with peaks of
granite, giving the impression of a range of mountains, buried all
but its highest points.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The original tribes of
the country are the <span class="sc">Fors</span> and the
<span class="sc">Dago</span>; the latter ruled for centuries over
the entire district from their inaccessible strongholds in Jebel
Marra. Tradition relates<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> that about the 14th
century the <span class="sc">Tungur</span> Arabs, emigrating south
from Tunis, scattered throughout Bornu and Wadai, and eventually
readied Darfur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> the
first arrivals being two brothers, Ali and Ahmed, who settled with
their flocks on the western slopes of Jebel Marra. Of these
brothers, Ahmed, nicknamed El Makur, was destined to become the
founder of a new dynasty in Darfur. He became very popular with the
then king Kor who not only gave him his favourite daughter as wife,
but nominated him as his successor to the throne. Accordingly on
Korâs death Ahmed succeeded to the throne of Darfur, and on the
news spreading to the Tungur of Wadai and Bornu, they flocked into
the country in such numbers as to partially displace the
<span class="sc">Teigo</span>. The only small settlements now left
of the former rulers are near Dara, where there is a Dago sheikh,
and also at Dar Sula, a long way to the west, where there is a
semi-independent ruler called âSultan Bekhit El Dagawi.â</p>

<p>A regular male succession was now established and a great
grandson of Ahmedâs was the celebrated Sultan Dali, who wrote the
Kitab-Dali or Penal Code. Another noted Sultan was Suleiman who
took the name of Solon, who being the son of an Arab mother and
himself married to an Arab woman, introduced Arab blood into the
Royal Family. It was through him, some 400 years ago, that the
country became Moslemised, and his descendants now proudly boast of
their Arab descent and quite ignore the black element which is
undoubtedly there, and which may account for the bitter enmity
which exists between the ruling Darfur family and the Nomad Arabs
of the country. At the end of the 18th century Sultan Abdel Rahman
married a <span class="sc">Beigo</span> girl and her son, Mohammed
El Fadl, became Sultan about the beginning of the next century. The
<span class="sc">Beigo</span> tribe, originally slaves, were from
that time declared free.</p>

<p>To turn to more recent times, Darfur has during the last 20
years been so devastated and depopulated that many formerly
important tribes such as the <span class="sc">Maharia</span>,
<span class="sc">Nawaiba</span>, <span class="sc">Mahamid</span>,
<span class="sc">Ereigat</span>, <span class="sc">Beni</span>,
<span class="sc">Hussein</span>, etc., have become so disintegrated
and scattered that they now practically cease to exist as tribes
and are seldom heard of.</p>

<p>The population of Darfur, prior to the Mahdiâs revolt, was
estimated at 1,500,000. It is now probably less than half that
number.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Furs.</span>The <span class=
"sc">Masabat</span> and <span class="sc">Kunjara</span>, the ruling
class of <span class="sc">Fors</span>, have their centre at El
Fasher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>The <span class=
"sc">Fors</span> are clean and industrious. They may be found
assembled under trees spinning, weaving cotton or plaiting mats,
whilst the children will be herding the cattle. The men wear a
jibba and drawers of coarse cotton stuff, whilst the women wear a
piece of the same stuff made fast round the hips with the end
thrown over the shoulder.</p>

<p>They live in tukls or conical huts, five or six of which
arranged in a circle form a habitation.</p>

<p>Compared to other tribes, they are exceedingly clean feeders and
very particular as to the manner in which their food is served,
though corn and merissa are the main articles of consumption.</p>

<p>They are religious and fanatical, and study the Koran
assiduously.</p>

<p>The mountainous stronghold of Jebel Marra is inhabited by the
<span class="sc">Jebelawin</span>, the aboriginal inhabitants of
Darfur.</p>

<p>The present ruler of Darfur is Sultan Ali Dinar, a grandson of
Sultan Mohammed Fadl; he was kept a prisoner at Omdurman during the
Mahdia. In September, 1898, immediately after the defeat of the
Khalifa at Kereri, he escaped to his native country. He now pays an
annual tribute to the Sudan Government by which he has been
officially recognised as its Agent in Darfur.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Administration.</span>The management of the internal
affairs of the country is left almost entirely to the sultan,
though the Sudan Government sends him instructions and advice on
certain matters from time to time as occasion arises. His judgments
on all administrative questions are based on a combination of the
Sharia Mohammedia and common law.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Army.</span>The sultan maintains an army,
organised on Dervish lines, of some 6,000 rifles, mostly of a more
or less antiquated description. In case of need he could probably
mobilise upwards of 2,000 horsemen. His chief commanders are
Mohammed Ali Dedingawi, Adam Rijal, and Kamar El Din. The greater
part of the army is quartered at El Fasher: the principal outlying
garrison (about 500 men) is at Jebel El Hella on the Fasher-Obeid
road.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Communications.</span>Though in 1874 it
took Colonel Mason, with a large caravan, from 100 to 150 days to
reach Fasher from Cairo, nowadays a letter from Cairo could reach
Fasher in 30 days without any difficulty.</p>

<p>In the old days the telegraph extended to Foga, now the furthest
point to which it is proposed at present to extend it is Nahud,
which is on the western frontier of Kordofan, and about 10 daysâ
camel ride from El Fasher.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">(1) With Omdurman.</span>There are two
routes from Omdurman to El Fasher. That most generally used is
<em>viÃ¢</em> El Obeid, Nahud, and Jebel El Hella. The other, which
has hitherto been avoided by merchants owing to the number of
robbers in the neighbourhood of Kaja Katul, and Serrug, lies to the
north of El Obeid, and, after passing the two above-mentioned
places, joins the El Obeid-Nahud route at Jebel El Hella. Both are
described in the route reports in <a href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74585/74585-h/74585-h.htm#route88">
Vol. II.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">(2) With Wadai.</span>There are three
routes from Fasher to Abesher, the capital of Wadai. The direct
road known as Sikkat El Masalat passes <em>viÃ¢</em> Kebkebia
(Darfur) and Bir Tawil to Abesher. This is not much used, in fact
Ali Dinar has forbidden merchants or pilgrims to use either this or
the northern route, as at Kebkebia there is a Fiki named Senin who
has defied all the sultanâs efforts to induce him to tender his
submission, and this road is consequently unsafe.</p>

<p>The northern route runs through Kutum, Dar Zaghawa, Dar Gimr,
and Dar Tama; this is known as Sikkat Zaghawa. Owing to recent
disturbances in Dar Zaghawa, this road is temporarily closed.</p>

<p>The southern route leads <em>viÃ¢</em> Keibe and the Wadi Azum to
Dar Sula and thence northwards to Abesher; this is known as Sikkat
Dar Sula, and is the longest of the three, but it is comparatively
safe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>Trade between Darfur and
other parts of the Sudan has increased a good deal of late. The
principal imports from the Nile are cotton goods (gomash), sugar,
and tea; the exports are feathers, ivory, pepper, rhinoceros horns,
and tobacco. The ivory, as a rule, comes from Dar Jange and Dar
Fertit in the south. Owing to the recent disturbances in Wadai,
ivory that formerly was exported through that country has been
finding its way <em>viÃ¢</em> El Fasher to Omdurman. A good many
camels and cattle are imported from Wadai and are exported again
<em>viÃ¢</em> Nahud to the Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Customs.</span>A royalty of about 20 per
cent. is taken on all ivory and feathers leaving Fasher, where the
price of ivory is from Â£15 to Â£16 per 100 lbs.</p>

<p>Every laden camel entering Darfur pays PT.150 to PT.180, and
each laden donkey PT.30 to PT.60.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Taxes.</span>The taxes are three in
number, Oshur, Zika, and Fitra. Oshur tax is assessed at the rate
of âth of the harvest, whilst Zika is 2 per cent. on all property
animals, goods, or money.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Currency.</span>The sultan has ordered
that the present Egyptian coinage shall be current in Darfur, but
merchants, finding they lose by it, are not anxious to introduce
it. At present the principal coins in use are âGirsh Kabashi,â 20
of which equal one rial Mejidi, the equivalent of PT.16.</p>

<p>There are also a few âGirsh Garagandiâ in use, these are of the
same value as the âKabashi.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport animals.</span>Camels are the
best transport animals, except in the mountainous and southern
regions, where mules, donkeys, or bullocks would be preferable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate, of course,
varies considerably. Fasher is healthy. In the south, where the
rains are heavier, there must be the usual malaria at certain
seasons. The climate of Jebel Marra is said to be cool and
healthy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>The people of Darfur, as
a whole, are followers of Islam, but the negroes in Jebel Marra,
the Jebelawin, and those in the south and south-west have no
religion. The late Sheikh Senussi wrote three times to Sultan Ali
Dinar asking him to prepare Zawias for him, and to otherwise
further his doctrine. Ali Dinar, however, considered it best to
politely hold aloof from him, and there are now no Senussiites in
El Fasher.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Produce</span>.</h5>

<p>The country may be divided into three sections with reference to
the vegetation, <em>i.e.</em>, the eastern zone of sandy steppes,
the central mountains, and the western zone.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Corn.</span>In the eastern zone, the
cultivation of corn, in the shape of dukhn and a little dura, is
the chief industry. A small quantity of simsim, cucumbers,
pumpkins, and water melons are also grown. In certain depressions
of the ground, where the presence of clay gives a stronger soil,
cotton is produced, but in no great quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The northern
part of the country is almost uncultivated; and in the west,
agriculture is pretty much the same as described for the eastern
portion, except that owing to the greater quantity of water, more
vegetables are grown.</p>

<p>The central mountainous district is the best watered and
richest, and accordingly the most thickly populated. Small
terraces, upon which gardens are laid out, are constructed all over
the slopes of the hills. Here barley, wheat, dukhn,<a id=
"FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class=
"fnanchor">[127]</a> dura, simsim, pumpkins, and melons are grown.
In the small water-courses, onions are planted during the dry
season. Honey of very good quality is collected in Jebel Marra.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cotton.</span>The cotton grown formerly
was excellent. Now very little is grown. Arabs manufacture from
wool a coarse material, but the Fors are ignorant of the process of
its manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Salt.</span>The production of salt is
carried on in many parts of Darfur.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Camels.</span>Camel breeding is the
principal pursuit of the Arabs in the north and east of Darfur.
North of 14Â° lat. camels used to be very numerous; they are now
comparatively scarce. The Zeiadia, Maharia, and Bedaiat are the
principal breeders.</p>

<p>The Arabs who breed camels occupy themselves with no other
industry, and have even to buy the corn used in their households,
which, with camelâs milk, satisfies all their wants.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle.</span>In the south, among the
sedentary inhabitants, cattle and sheep are to be found in
abundance.</p>

<p>The cattle are of two kinds: the humped species and the
so-called African species, with long horns. The former are compact,
well-made animals, and become very fat; the others are not worth
much.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sheep.</span>The sheep have but little
wool, but their flesh is good; among the Zaghawa there is a species
with long curly hair. Zaghawa is leased to the present sultanâs
sister, Miriam Tajer.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Goats.</span>Goats abound everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Horses.</span>The Baggara Arabs confine
themselves chiefly to breeding cattle and horses. The Messeria are
large horse-owners.</p>

<p>Horse breeding is largely carried on by the Mahamid tribe. The
horses are small in size but very strong, and are said to be able
on an emergency to travel for 60 hours without water. They are
chiefly of a local breed (Tama).</p>

<p>The sultan has a stud farm in the Zeiadia country, with the
object of improving and reviving the breed of horses.</p>

<h5><em>Towns.</em>
</h5>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Fasher.</span>The old capital was
Kobe, but at the end of the 17th century it was moved to El Fasher
which is now the chief town. Colonel Gordon in 1877 described it as
a most miserable place, though once a populous and thriving town
under the sultans. It is 388 miles by road from El Obeid, or about
650 miles from Khartoum, and about 300 miles nearly due east from
Abesher.</p>

<p>El Fasher or Tendelti stands mostly on the western bank of the
Wadi Tendelti or Dindil in an angle formed by the junction of the
latter with the Wadi El Ko.</p>

<p>The Tendelti has no current of its own, but is filled during the
rains by the overflow from the Ko, and a dam, constructed near the
junction, retains the water for some time. The wells supplying the
town are all sunk in its bed.</p>

<p>The town now consists almost entirely of tukls and box-shaped
straw sheds. There are about five or six mud houses, and the sultan
intends to build himself a palace, the plans and material for which
have been already sent to him from Khartoum.</p>

<p>On the town side, opposite the old palace, the old Government
constructed a square fort with ditch and parapet. This is now
demolished.</p>

<p>The population of the town was, in 1875, about 2,650. Of
theseâ1,700 were natives, 300 Zeiadia Arabs, 250 SÃ¢bah Arabs, 400
Melha Arabs. The population is now estimated at about 10,000.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dara.</span>There are now no other towns
of importance. Dara, which used to be second in importance to
Fasher, and the headquarters of a mudiria, is merely a small tukl
village.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Melit.</span>Melit is the name of rather
a populous district in the north. Here there is a plentiful water
supply from wells 9 to 12 feet deep in a khor, which also contains
many date trees.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tura.</span>The ancient burial place of
the sultans is at Tura in Jebel Marra.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c08s3"></a><span class="sc">Section 3.âThe Shilluks
and their Country</span>.<a id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></h3>

<p>The Shilluk nation, the only people in the Sudan who acknowledge
one head as immediate ruler or mek, extends along the west bank of
the Nile from Kaka in the north to Lake No in the south. There is
also a colony along the banks of the Sobat, near its mouth,
extending 35 miles up this river to Nagdyeb, and chiefly living on
the north bank.</p>

<p>The country is almost entirely a grass country, and as a result
its wealth consists almost entirely of cattle.</p>

<p>A large and increasing amount of dura and other vegetables is
grown, but it is often barely enough for the needs of the
population, and with bad harvests famines are constantly
occurring.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Description of the people.
Appearance.</span>Physically, the Shilluks, Shulla, or Ojallo
(native names) are a fine race. In colour they are glossy
blue-black. The average height of the men is quite 5 feet 10
inches, and that of the women is in proportion. According to
European ideas they are narrow in the shoulders and thin in the
calves in proportion to their height, but they are capable of
sustaining considerable fatigue on short rations, and are
courageous and moral in their sexual relations.</p>

<p>Every man carries and cherishes a long spear, with a
laurel-leaf-shaped blade and a tuft of ostrich feathers near the
butt; when prepared for war he carries also a knob-kerry, an extra
throwing spear or two, and a light oblong shield of wickerwork or
hide. The hair is twisted by means of a mixture of gum, mud, and
cow-dung, into a series of extraordinary shapes, <em>e.g.</em>,
cockscombs, âtam oâshanterâ-like halos, plumes a foot high, knobs,
etc., etc. Few clothes are worn, occasionally a twist of cloth or a
leopardâs skin, but as a rule the men go stark naked. The
women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> are more
clothed. A large proportion of the Sudanese battalions are drawn
from Shilluks, though no conscription is enforced.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">History and religion.</span>The legendary
history and the religion of the Shilluks are related on <a href=
"#Page_197">page 197.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character.</span>In character they are
haughty and independent, and hate foreigners, according to the
lessons instilled by the older men who suffered under the âTurks,â
the Danagla slave-dealers, and the Dervishes. Under the present
regime it is hoped that this feeling will die out. They are also
crafty, quarrelsome, and untrustworthy as a rule; at the same time
they are thick-headed and obstinate; but, as aforesaid, their
morals in relation to women are very good; they have a fine sense
of discipline, and become very much attached to their leaders,
whether black or white; they are exceedingly plucky, and they are
the finest warriors in the Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population.</span>The country is thickly
populated for its size. Right away from Kaka to Lake No is a
continuous string of villages lying about a mile from the river.
There are only two points in the whole of this distance at which
the interval between villages exceeds two miles, and these are at
the points where grazing is bad (between Akurwa and Nun, and
between Nielwag and Nyagwado). There are, in addition, eight groups
of villages which lie 12 to 22 miles inland, away from the
river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Villages.</span>A careful census of the
river villages in 1903 gave a result of 1,010 villages, 8,693
domiciles, and 39,312 souls.</p>

<p>Shilluk villages are invariably built in a circle, the open
space in the centre containing nothing but a meeting-house for men
only, and almost invariably a temple erected to a grandfather or
great-grandfather of the reigning chief. Each domicile consists
usually of three or four tukls, enclosed by a dura stalk fence. The
houses are kept scrupulously clean by the women. A family occupies
two or three huts; one is reserved for the householder with his
wife, another as a cook-house, where merissa is also made, and the
third is occupied by the retainers and children of the house. Dr.
Schweinfurth records the existence of Shilluk villages of 200 huts.
The largest village is Atwadoi, consisting of 120 domiciles, in a
district of the same name north of Kodok. The constitutional
laziness of the tribe does not prevent their erecting very
well-built tukls, and many men are most proficient in thatching the
roofs. The crest or peak of the tukl being completed, the workman
descends, and a sheep is at once killed by the future occupant and
eaten by the workmen, whose reward is completed by a further
donation of two sheep.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Domestic life.</span>A wife can be had
for a milch cow and four to five oxen, but this is a high price to
pay at present. This purchase money cannot be collected by many all
their lives. The Shilluks keep one, two, or three wives; a very few
exceed this number.</p>

<p>The Shilluk woman is fruitful; there are some with eight or nine
children; three, four and five children seem to be the average
issue. In former times, it is said, the number of children was much
larger.</p>

<p>Having cost the man much money and trouble the woman is well
looked after and treated. Aided by the girls she has she does her
house work. She helps her husband honestly in the field. She is
permitted to remain for weeks on a visit to her relatives. If
disobedient the man gives her a thrashing on the back with a rope
end, but this occurs very seldom.</p>

<p>The education of the children consists practically of the
phrase, âDo just the same as you see me doing.â</p>

<p>The native at home knows of no science or profession, hence
schools and house tasks are out of the question. Girls learn from
their mothers house, field and plaiting work. The boys are all
cattle-tenders. At the age of 13 to 15 years they start the
cultivation of a small field, and grow up to manhood by degrees,
acquiring the means for a house and a wife.</p>

<p>As long as they are young, children are obedient, but they take
no notice of what the parents say as soon as they are able to carry
out any work by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>The cultivation
carried on during the rainy season requires hard work, which the
Shilluk is not inclined to give except for short periods at a time.
The soil is, along the river, very rich and black, about 12 feet
thick, and is named âdo doâ; inland it is poorer. Owing to the
richness, weeds grow apace, and the land has to be weeded two or
three times to avoid the young dura being choked. When gathered,
thieves, mice, and elephants reduce the stock considerably, and
even when he has produced, by dint of hard work, a fair pile of
dura the native does not use it economically, for he eats a great
deal at a time, gives generously to his poorer friends, and sells
it badly.</p>

<p>Maize, beans, melons, ful (ground nuts), sesame, and cotton are
also grown, but in only sufficient quantities for local wants. The
cotton cultivation could probably be extended.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle breeding.</span>The chief
occupation of the Shilluk is, however, cattle breeding. To him it
represents property and wives. The amount of cattle in the country
is unfortunately smaller than formerly, for it has been reduced
largely by the depredations of the Danagla, the Dervishes, and even
their own kings. In comparison with the Dinkas they are poor
indeed, for a Dinka will willingly part with 20 or more oxen and
cows for a wife, whereas the Shilluk can only pay one cow and three
or four oxen with difficulty.</p>

<p>The cattle census of 1903 amounted to only 12,173 head of cattle
and 63,473 sheep and goats in the whole country,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> but they are increasing. The
cattle are large and of a good stamp, and breed well, but the sheep
and goats (the former of whom have hair, not wool) are small and
stunted. Many cattle die every year of disease, in spite of every
care being taken. One-sixth part of the sheep and goats, it is
said, die during the rains, and these animals are especially
exposed, not only to crocodiles, but to glanders and a sort of
guinea worm which burrows between the hoofs.</p>

<p>During the dry season herds migrate to different parts of the
country, the majority of those owned by the central district
crossing over to the east bank of the Nile, to return when the new
grass springs up. Similarly the cattle of the Sobat Shilluks
descend to the lagoons south of the Sobat and graze with the herds
of Obai and Fennikang. All the youths and boys over 10 years old
accompany them, leaving their homes for several weeks.</p>

<p>The grass of Shilluk land generally gives little nourishment.
Milk is therefore scanty. If one possesses even herds of cows the
result in milk is small; curiously enough three or four out of
every 10 are barren. A cow is never slaughtered; like man, it ought
to expire by itself. Oxen are only killed on festal occasions, such
as funeral dinners, etc. Mutton and goatsâ meat are usually only
eaten at festival dinners and ceremonies, or when the animal
expires; or in cases of human sickness.</p>

<p>It is therefore very difficult to buy cattle from the Shilluks,
for they cannot obtain wives for cash. It is simply impossible to
buy a milch cow.</p>

<p>Old soldiers who have returned home to their native land, where
they never get a piece of meat to eat, hanker after the flesh pots
of Egypt, where they had meat nearly every day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Crafts.</span>The Shilluks have their own
blacksmiths, potters, thatchers, pipemakers, surgeons,
boat-builders, and basket and hair plaiters.</p>

<p>The blacksmiths are very skilful; they prepare spears, spades
for building, small axes, fishing rods, big harpoons, picks, arm
rings, bells and chains, etc. Their handicraft is a travelling one;
they take their tools and go about from one place to another. The
pay of a blacksmith is good. The employer has to support the man
working for him, and makes him a present of sheep besides.</p>

<p>Pottery is the handicraft of the women. They make pots,
pitchers, heads for smoking pipes in any form, and make them well.
They are paid in food for their work.</p>

<p>The thatchers make not only watertight but also very neat roofs;
a skilful European cannot make one better.</p>

<p>Snake stings and damage from blows or spear wounds are numerous.
For the treatment of these evils the surgeons are called in. In
their work they chop and cut most unmercifully, but although they
inflict much pain they often save lives.</p>

<p>To make canoes out of crooked pieces of wood is the work of the
ship-builders, and, with the poor tools they have, they make fairly
satisfactory boats.</p>

<p>The plaiting of baskets and straw mats is done by both sexes.
The species of grass here being not well adapted for plaiting, the
production is not grand; however, the result meets the demand.</p>

<p>The nimbus-like and other head-dresses of hair worn by the
Shilluks are masterly work.</p>

<p>Families carry on these respective trades for generations, and
the father and mother impart their skill to their children and next
relatives.</p>

<p>Building houses, carving and polishing clubs and spear sticks
and other common work is understood by every Shilluk.</p>

<p>There are villages which are especially distinguished; some in
fishing or hunting, some in cattle-breeding, others in cultivating
dura, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Occupation.</span>During the rainy
season, old and young, men and women, are busy; anyone who visits
the country at this time of the year would believe them to be a
hardworking people. At this time work is very fatiguing; no
European could do it on such a meagre fare as that of the Shilluks.
Diseases, fever, dysentery, colds, coughs, and pulmonary ailments
are also rife at this season, both among the natives and their
cattle.</p>

<p>During the dry season, however, there is not much to do; at most
there are houses to be built and repaired, and this is done by
young men. The old ones, viz., from 35 years onwards, do nothing
but lie about or pay visits.</p>

<p>At this time of the year Shilluks begin to travel. Relatives pay
mutual visits, and marriageable young men go to the Nuers and
Dinkas with spears, wire, stuffs and dura, which they exchange for
sheep and calves.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Industries. Fishing.</span>Fishing is
precariously carried out in shallow waters, either by spearing
(horizontally, with bow-shaped fishing spears) or by pouncing on
the fish with hemispherical wicker traps somewhat like lobster
pots. Neither nets nor fishing lines appear to be used.
<span class="sidenote">Hippo hunting.</span>Hippopotamus hunting is
done by combined parties in canoes or dug-outs, harpooning the
hippopotamus and despatching him with spears when he comes to the
surface to breathe. These animals, it may be remarked in passing,
are very savage, doing much harm on the land and gratuitously
attacking canoes, etc., in the water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>From January to April the
climate is not bad, though April is the warmest month of the year.
June to September constitutes the rainy season,<a id=
"FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class=
"fnanchor">[130]</a> and from October to December the country is
flooded with water: but the marshes and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_196">[196]</span> khors all dry up by April. From November to
April the climate, though certainly not perfect, has little effect
on a healthy constitution, provided good food, water, clothing, and
a house are available. October is perhaps the worst month of the
year.</p>

<p class="cp1">SHILLUK WARRIORS.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Relations with the Dinkas.</span>The
Shilluks do not, as a rule, agree well with the Dinkas, and there
are big contrasts between the two races. The Dinka possesses many
cattle and prepares his food with milk, whilst the Shilluk has only
a few cattle and sprinkles his food with the dust obtained from
drying and grinding dura stalks; for this he is despised by the
Dinka.</p>

<p>Taken on the whole, the Dinkas are much more intelligent than
the Shilluks. When Shilluk boys are unable to find a reply to the
pointed remarks of a Dinka boy, they raise their sticks
threateningly and say âThe Dinka boy has a sharp tongue and must be
flogged till he is quiet,â which generally stops the rather vulgar
expressions used by Dinka boys.</p>

<p>The Dinkas are said to have formerly lived on the right bank of
the lower Sobat, but were driven inland by the Shilluks.</p>

<p>Incited by a few Arabs, the Shilluks in former times used to
raid the Dinkas and carry away their women and cattle. They however
live peaceably now, thanks to the fear they have of the new
Government. The two races now and then pay mutual visits, and also
intermarry occasionally; a certain amount of trade is carried on
between them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arab and other immigrants.</span>There
are a few Selim Baggara in the neighbourhood of Kaka, but these
people appear to visit the district only after the harvest to
purchase dura from the Shilluks, which they are too indolent to
cultivate themselves.</p>

<p>The Kenana Arabs, under Sheikh Faki Hamed, occupy, though they
are not allowed to monopolise, the wells at Atara. They are
disliked by the Shilluks on account of their dirty habits.</p>

<p>Another branch of the Kenana Arabs occupy a village close to
Fadiang. This branch of the tribe dwells in 60 domiciles. Fama
(Sheikh Yogagieb Wad Awell), a sub-district of Nyagir, contains a
mixed population of Nubawis and Shilluks; the former cultivate dura
largely. They were originally driven into this district by the
Khalifaâs people when the latter were at Fungor, and under the
Sheikh Nail they inhabit five villages, consisting of 104
domiciles, and are subject to the Shilluk Sheikh Yogagieb Wad Awel.
In Fama there is also a Gowama Arab village of 40 dwellings, under
Sheikh Abu El Gasim, who collected these people at Taiara on the
approach of the Khalifa, and permanently settled them in his
present village. The list of immigrants to Fama district is
completed by the mention of the Hawazma Arabs, under Sheikh Abu El
Wahab Walad Handigai. From their own account they are fearless
hunters of the elephant.</p>

<p>A sprinkling of Kenana Arabs is to be found temporarily living
in villages as far south as Dusim, and a family or two of Felata
hail from Jebel Eliri, but these are not permanent residents.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Administration.</span>Since time
immemorial the Shilluk nation has been governed by a Mek or King,
and the list of reigning monarchs since the beginning is known to
every well-educated Shilluk (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_199">p.
199</a>). For administrative purposes the country has been divided
for a long time into two provinces, that of Gerr (sub-divided into
Kaka, or Moama, and Kodok). which extends to Bol (inclusive), and
that of Loak, which extends from Fadiet (south of Bol) to Tonga and
Lake No. Each of the three districts is under a head sheikh,
residing in Oriang, Debalo, and Nyabanjo respectively, and the
whole is subject to a mek or king, elected in a ceremonious manner
by all the headmen of the sub-districts.</p>

<p>Up till the last representative, Kur Wad Nedok, the meks had
supreme power, which appears to have been wielded in a somewhat
arbitrary manner. Wad Nedok was deposed in the spring of 1903 for
numerous malpractices, and his successor, Fadiet Wad Kwad Keir, is
now limited in power, and is subservient in most things to the
Governor of the Upper Nile Province, a British officer resident in
the town of Kodok. (<em>Vide</em> Chap. I, <a href="#Page_2">p.
2</a>).</p>

<p>For administration the country is still further divided into two
provinces, the northern and southern, containing 29 districts
altogether; the principal ones are:â</p>

crossing deep khors which are filled with water all the year round.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> Lolle river,
nearly 200 yards wide throughout, flows past the villages of the

Oashi, Awarajok, and Fannidwai, and emerges into the main stream at
a village named Warajok, where the telegraph cable crosses the
river. This stream is about 13 feet deep throughout. It is known to
old native navigators as the Bahr El Harami; sailing boats with

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>There is little game in the
thickly inhabited Shilluk country itself. A little way inland,
however, elephant, lion, antelope, etc., are plentiful, and more
especially is this the case near the river towards Lake No. The
neighbourhood of Kaka and north of it is also a grand game
country.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c08b"></a>APPENDIX.</h3>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">History and Religion of the
Shilluks</span>.</p>

<p>In the beginning was Jo-uk, the Great Creator, and he created a
great white cow, who came up out of the Nile and was called Deung
Adok. The white cow gave birth to a man-child whom she nursed and
named Kola (Kollo); Kola begat Umak Ra or Omaro, who begat Makwa or
Wad Maul, who begat Ukwa. These people lived in a far off country,
nobody knows where. (Bahr El Ghazal (?), Jur tribe (?) according to
linguistic links).</p>

<p>Ukwa was one day sitting near the river when he saw two lovely
maidens with long hair rise out of the river and play about in the
shallows. He saw them many times after that, but they would have
nothing to do with him and merely laughed at him. It should be
mentioned that their lower extremities were like those of a
crocodile.</p>

<p>One day Ukwa found them sitting on the banks, so he came up
behind and seized them. Their screams brought their father, Ud
Diljil, out of the river, to see what was the matter. Ud Diljil,
whose right side was green in colour and in form like a crocodile,
whilst his left side was that of a man, protested mildly, but
allowed Ukwa to take away his daughters and wed them, merely giving
vent to a series of incorrect prophecies regarding them.</p>

<p>Nik-kieya, the elder sister, gave birth to two sons and three
daughters, and Ung-wad, the younger, to one son only, named Ju, or
Bworo. The eldest son of Nik-kieya was named Nyakang (Nik-kang or
Nyakam) and inherited the pleasing crocodilian attributes of his
mother and grandfather. Meanwhile Ukwa married a third wife, whose
eldest child, a son, was named Duwat.</p>

<p>On Ukwaâs death there was a furious quarrel between Nyakang and
Duwat as to who should succeed Ukwa. It ended by Nyakang, with his
sisters Ad Dui, Ari Umker, and Bun Yung, his brother Umoi and his
half-brother Ju, acquiring wings and flying away to the south of
the Sobat. Here they found the Shilluk country inhabited by wicked
Arabs, so they drove them out and founded a most successful
kingdom. According to their genealogy this would have been about
1200 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>, or later.</p>

<p>Nyakang had a creative power which he used greatly to the
advantage of the kingdom. In order to people the vast territory
more quickly, he proceeded to create a people from the animal life
he found in the forests and rivers. From crocodiles and
hippopotami, and from wild beasts and cattle, he created men and
women. When these had brought forth many children, the parent stock
was removed by death, so that the children might not know of their
origin.</p>

<p>The new creation and their offspring form the Shulla race or
common people, in distinction from the direct descendants of
Nyakangâs family. The latter continue to bear authority and fill
the priestly function to this day. All outside the royal and
priestly line are accounted Shullas.</p>

<p>Nik-kieya still exists. She never died and never will. The
western part of the Sobat and part of the White Nile near there is
her favourite abode. She often appears, usually in the form of a
crocodile, but at times in different forms and always in the river
or on its banks. No sacrifices are ever offered to her. When she
wishes, she takes what is required from among men and beasts; and
when it is so, the people must not complain; indeed, it is an
honour when Nik-kieya is pleased to take her sacrifice of man or
beast from a family.</p>

<p>Nik-kieya becomes judge also in certain difficult cases, it is
said, particularly in cases of illegitimate children. When the man
accused denies fatherhood, the case is turned over to Nik-kieya.
The disputants are taken to the river bank, and along with them a
goat. They are then put into the river, and the one that Nik-kieya
carries off is judged guilty, and he or she is left in the hands of
Nik-kieya, to be punished. The beauty of this method is that a
consciousness of guilt, added to a belief in and fear of Nik-kieya
often causes confession, and thus the case is ended. It is not
quite clear why the goat is taken to the river. It may be to give
Nik-kieya a chance for a sacrifice without taking a human being, or
it may be because a goat tied close to the river will attract
crocodile from quite a distance. To Nik-kieya are ascribed many
wonderful miracles, and it is feared also that in actual practice
she becomes a cloak for sin.</p>

<p>Around this mythical being and her demi-god son are wrapped many
superstitions, not the least of which is that sacrifices to and the
worship of, the great deity Jo-uk, are carried out by the
intermediary of Nyakang, the demi-god.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Jo-uk is
recognised as the father and source of all life, of evil as well as
good. He is treated rather as a deity to be feared and propitiated,
but he enters into the small relations of life all the same, and
most incidents, such as death, sickness, going on a journey, etc.,
are referred to his action. The Shilluks believe that Jo-uk is
everywhere, and that man when he dies goes to Jo-uk; but whether
anything happens to him in consequence seems doubtful.</p>

<p>To Jo-uk sacrifices are made at least once a year, at the
beginning of the rainy season, and much of good and evil are
attributed to him. This sacrifice consists in the slaying of an
animal by the priest of each village for the people of his village,
assembled at the house of the âNyakang.â The animal is slain with a
holy spear, and the flesh divided among the people, cooked and
eaten. Then follows a dance, with much drinking of merissa to make
their hearts merry. For this sacrifice and dance, which is
apparently the sum of their worship, there are especial houses. But
in each village there is a small temple, similar in structure to
the larger one. In this, or more correctly, around this, the elders
of the people assemble for the transaction of all serious business,
and call their gods to witness in all covenants. No village is
without this small temple, and it is the only building on which any
ornamentation is attempted. It is called the house of Nyakang, not
the house of Jo-uk.</p>

<p>In cases of illness sacrifices are made to Nyakang. The Shilluks
bury their dead inside the confines of their villages close to the
house where the deceased had lived, killing a bullock at the wake,
the horns of which are set up to mark the place of interment.</p>

<p>Kur Wad Nedok was appointed king by the Dervishes as a reward,
it is said, for betraying Mek Yor Adodit to them. During Kurâs
absence in Omdurman, Akol was appointed mek by the Shilluks. Ak Kwo
Kwan, son of Akol, is a pretender to the throne, but has few
adherents.</p>

<p>It is related that all kings from Dag to Nyadok were killed by
the Shilluks. Kwad Keir, Ajang, and Gwin Kun fell by the hand of
the âTurks.â Yor fell in fight with the Dervishes. Kur abdicated.
Akol is dead; he is said to have been shot by the Dervishes. The
descendants of the kings are called âGwared,â in contrast with the
ordinary Shilluks, who are called âOroro.â The royal descendants
form the upper class, while the Oroko are at the beck and call of
the kings.</p>

<p>The idea of kingship is implanted wherever the Gwared exist, and
the latter are numerous. It is, therefore, not easy to exterminate
the idea of royalty.</p>

<p>Royalty in this country is royalty, both by selection and
inheritance at the same time. It is so by selection because the
leading men of the country select the king from a variety of
claimants, and by right of inheritance, inasmuch as only sons of
kings are entitled to ascend the throne.</p>

<p>The right of accession to the throne is acknowledged as
belonging primarily to the sons of the late king.</p>

<p class="sch">COUNTRY WEST OF THE NILE, SOUTH OF LAT. 22Â° AND

<p>This district readily lends itself to division for description
into three sections, viz.:â</p>

<p>1.âDesert west of the Nile, north and west of Wadi El Gab,
including Arbain road (for detailed report of which <em>vide</em>

<h3><a id="p1c09s1"></a><span class="sc">Section 1.âDesert West of
Nile, North and West of Wadi El Gab</span>.</h3>

<p>The country west of the Nile from Halfa to Kerma merits little
description. Desert of the most arid description comes down close
to the banks of the river, west of which all is uninhabited and
waterless, with the exception of the few oases, for as far as is
known upwards of 300 to 400 miles. The desert itself varies from
hard, often stony sand or gravel-covered plains, to undulating
moving sand dunes and rocky hills of lime, granite, or basalt.
Remains of petrified forests are occasionally met. The amount of
mineral wealth discovered in this inhospitable region is not yet
definitely known.</p>

<p>Here and there a very limited amount of vegetation is met, at
some spot where the water of one of the rare rainstorms that pass
over this district has chanced to collect, but more often one may
travel for miles and miles over country devoid of any vestige of
animal or vegetable life.</p>

<p>The whole of this desert region, including the wells and oases,
is uninhabited. It is, however, visited occasionally by roving
bands of Hawawir and Kababish in search of natron or wild dates, as
also by raiding parties of the Bedaiat, a tribe living to the north
of Darfur, who only recently drove off camels grazing within 80
miles of Dongola.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from a report by Captain H. Hodgson,
February, 1903, descriptive of the country west of the Wadi El
Gab.</p>

<p>âBeyond the limits of the Wadi El Gab, on the western side,
there seems to be a belt of country in which water is easily found,
but is undrinkable. Of the two water pans I have tried, namely
Murrat and Butta, the one is very bitter and the other has a
distinct smell of sulphuretted hydrogenâArabs use these waters
medicinally as purgatives.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Jebel Abiad.</span>âI reached and
ascended the plateau of Jebel Abiad at what I reckon, roughly, to
be 100 miles west from the river at Khandak. In 1901 I found the
northern extremity of this range to be 98 miles from the river at
Dongola. It is, on the eastern side, a high steep bluff, exposing
the white rock (gypsum) from which it gets its name. It extends
continuously from where I stood, both north and south, as far as
the horizon.</p>

<p>âThe surface of the plateau is shingle and sand; it slopes
gently down on the western side.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wadi Natrun.</span>âI reached the Natrun
valley on the 31st January. It is not literally a valley, but an
undulating plain stretching south and south-west as far as the
horizon. From south-east to north-east it is bounded by a high
range of steep hills of black rock; from north-east to north-west
by high broken rocky ground with isolated conical hills; to the
west, by low gravel hills. On the distant horizon, north-west, is a
high range of hills. Close under the bluff on the eastern side of
the plain are two thickets of selem bushes, growing luxuriantly and
suffering in places from over supply of water. This is very
plentiful and near the surface, the sand being brown and damp, but
it is not the best water in the valley. The southern of these two
thickets is called Melani. An isolated peak in the northern centre
of the plain, called Jebel Kashaf, lies at a bearing of 315Â° mag.
from Melani. The best water, called Bir Sultan, lies 3 miles from
Melani at a bearing of 278Â° mag. and due south of Jebel Kashaf. On
the ground called Bir Sultan (which includes an area of about Â¼
square mile, covered with tussocks of Halfa grass, etc.), I found
three or four pans of good water, the soil below the sand being
white clay. There is a small clump of date seedlings near the
biggest spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>There is plenty
of evidence of natron in the valley, but the place, where most of
the digging is done and where the thickest seam of natron is
reported to be, is 2,400 yards from Jebel Kashaf and to the west of
it, at a bearing of 310Â° (mag.). The diggings are in what looks
like a dry salt pan left by the sea, except that the sand is very
red. The method of collecting it is as follows: About 2 to 4 inches
depth of sand is cleared away until the natron, a substance
resembling a yellowish rock salt, is reached; the top part is
usually bad, being half sand. Then there is a seam Â½ to 2 inches
thick, of good natron, and again below a little bad natron, and
then below all sand again. Sometimes all the natron is spoilt by
being mixed with sand. Near the natron diggings is a large thicket
of selem bushes, and besides this and at Melani, there is a clump
of date trees and selem north-east of Jebel Kashaf and another
thicket of âlittelâ scrub, besides plenty of halfa, tamam, taklis,
and halaf grass etc. A party of 400 or 500 camels could live some
months in the valley on the grazing only. Good shelter can be
obtained from the wind, and there are plenty of garids etc. to make
tukls. Gazelle plentiful.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arbain road.</span>âThe Arbain road lies
along very high land, and anyone traversing the road during the
winter months should, if possible, march with the wind,
<em>i.e.</em>, from north to south. The cold was intense, and the
shelter from north wind nil, as all hills are steep on the north
side and slope gradually away to the south.</p>

<p>âAt Sultan, Lagia, and Selima this is reversed, and the hills
are steep on the south side. This change in formation accounts
probably for the presence of water.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>This desert region is the
haunt of the Addax, the rarest of Sudan antelopes. Specimens have

aperient. Good grazing and plenty of firewood. This is a watering
place on the Arbain road.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Terfaui</span> (I).âAbout 6 miles north of
Sheb, situate in a small oasis in a broad wadi said to lead from
the oasis of Selima to the Nile by way of Kurkur. This valley is
bounded on the west by precipitous sandstone cliffs. There is a
group of trees here 250 by 300 yards. Good grazing for camels. The
water is drinkable. Immediately to the west of Terfaui is a pass
over which the usual road to the northern oases of Beris, etc.,
passes. This is usually a watering place on the Arbain road.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Abu Hussein</span>.âAbout 35 miles north-west
of Sheb. Consists of a clump of trees and bush-covered mounds about
30 feet high. There are three more places exactly similar to Abu
Hussein, two being to the eastward and one to the west. They are
all about 5 miles apart and lie in a general line from east to
west. Water may be found at a depth of 1Â½ feet at any of them, and
here and there between them. Good water and plentiful. Grazing also
good.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Terfaui</span> (II).â16 miles north-west of Abu
Hussein or about 50 miles north-west of Sheb. It consists of small
mounds of sand covered with long green grass. Water plentiful at
depth of 4 to 5 feet, grazing good, consisting of tufts of long
grass, over an area of about 1 mile by Â¾ mile. There used to be
three dom palms here, but these were burnt down by Captain Ross in
1894 on account of the snakes which infested them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kassaba</span>.âThe northernmost well in the
Sheb district is at Naseib, 15 miles north of Kassaba. At Kassaba
the water is not good, but many old wells point to its having been
much used in former days. Situated in an open plain about 26 miles
N.N.W. of Sheb. A watering place on the Arbain road.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Selima Oasis</span>.âSelima lies on the Arbain
road about 78 miles south of Sheb and 55 miles west of the river at
Sagiet El Abd. Halfa is about 120 miles to the north-east. It is
perhaps the most important oasis in the western<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> desert of the Sudan, as not
only must caravans using the Arbain route almost necessarily stop
here for water, but its dates and salt are probably of considerable
value from a commercial point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. James Currie, who visited this oasis in October, 1901, thus
describes it:â</p>

<p>âA most beautiful place. It would be most difficult to find
without a guide, as it is really only a large hole in the desert.
The descent to it is very steep indeed. There are three wells, a
good many date trees, and good grass. One sees the remains of an
old Christian convent, moderately well preserved, but the point of
interest attaching to it is that it has apparently been built out
of the ruins of something much older, to judge from the inscribed
stones one notices. There are abundant salt deposits near, and a
huge petrified forest, which extends further than I had time or
inclination to go.â</p>

<p>Captain H. Hodgson (February, 1903) writes with reference to
this oasis:â</p>

<p>âBesides the old salt workings, which are capable of
considerable development, there are some 2,000 fruit-bearing date
trees. My estimate may not be very near, but I spent two hours with
two other men counting in order to get this idea, and in this time
counted 685 female trees, and covered only about one third of the
ground. The trees are uncleaned with very thick undergrowth, and
are being ruthlessly hacked in order to enable the Arabs (Hassanab
from Kosha) to get at the fruit. Dates of the following species
were collected: Kulma, Agwa, Barakawi, and Gawa. The first and
second are both of considerable commercial value: the Agwa trees
seem the most numerous.â</p>

<h4 class="space-above1"><em>The Northern Branch of the Wadi El
Gab.</em>
</h4>

<p class="sch3">(<em>By Major A. E. Turner, R.A., December</em>,
1884.)</p>

<p>The northern branch of the Wadi El Gab extends from Hannek to
the village of SawÄni, 20 miles due west of El Ordi, or Kasr
Dongola.</p>

<p>It is a flat tract mostly sandy, but there are many stony plains
and occasional rocky hills, as well as plains where salt and lime
crop to the surface. The natives collect the salt, and carry it to
the villages on the Nile, where they barter it for grain, etc.
There are many wells, and round these wells the straw-built huts
are congregated, forming villages; there are numerous, and some
very fine, palms, both dom and date, near the wells, and these in
some places mark the site of deserted villages, where the wells
have dried up.</p>

<p>The people at the present time (1884) have very few
camels,<a id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class=
"fnanchor">[133]</a> except milch and young. They have sold a great
many, and a good many are employed by contract between Dongola and
Sarras on the west bank.</p>

<p>The villages are all built near the wells, and in deep reddish
sand.</p>

<p>There is no ground for cultivation whatever, and hardly any
grass (halfa or other); the trees are palms, acacias (the latter
very fine and old).</p>

<p>Leaving Hafir and the Nile, the road leads S.S.W., crossing a
plain covered with stones and shingle, with scanty mimosa shrubs;
at 9 miles a low ridge is mounted, and the Wadi El Gab is visible
with the village of <span class="sidenote">Lagia.</span>Lagia and
its palms 5 miles distant. At 13Â½ miles, the ruins of three old
buildings are met, one on the west, two on the south side of the
road; one of the latter is a ruined convent or monastery, and its
cells are visible. Many of the palms are burnt, having been
destroyed by their owners who went to join the Mahdia. 4 miles
S.S.W. is the village of <span class="sidenote">Abu
Naama.</span>Abu Naama. Seven miles south-west the village of
<span class="sidenote">El Mungur.</span>El Mungur, which has two

<span class="sidenote">Abu Baguga.</span>Abu Baguga, and 1 mile
south-west of it that of <span class="sidenote">Abu
Halfa.</span>Abu Halfa.</p>

further lies, on the east of the road, the village of <span class=
"sidenote">Sarari, Dukur, deserted.</span>Sarari, now deserted, and
that of Dukur on the west, also deserted. At 3 miles further, the

deserted.</span>Ain El Bir, a mile from the road on our left
(east), and just beyond it a solitary rocky hill called
<span class="sidenote">Mount El Kwais.</span>El Kwais.</p>

<p>At 9 miles the road mounts a ridge, and then descends into a
sort of circular basin about 1 mile in diameter, surrounded by low
hills. On leaving this at 10 miles, I saw the village of
<span class="sidenote">Goz El Fugar.</span>Goz El Fugar 1 mile to
the left (east), and Â¾ mile further I arrived at the village of
<span class="sidenote">Bayuda.</span>Bayuda, on a sandy hill, with

Gumra.</span>El Gumra, and 2 miles further, also on the west side,
that of <span class="sidenote">Zalia.</span>Zalia; at 7Â½ miles a

is reached, called <span class="sidenote">El Kurmotai.</span>El

village of SawÄni, the sheikhâs own village and chief village of
the Wadi Gab. Some of the huts are built of mud, but mostly of
straw.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">SawÄni.</span>SawÄni is a very
picturesque village with a large open space on the south side,
bounded on three sides by trees, and on the fourth side lies the

hills is crossed, at the east foot of which lies the small village
of <span class="sidenote">Um Hellal (1).</span>Um Hellal, at Â½ mile

road is passed; a mile further, rocky ground is reached, which
gradually rises, and 1 mile further the Wadi Gab ceases, and the
road goes over bare, rocky, and broken ground to Dongola. The
latter is 26 miles from SawÄni.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wells.</span>The wells are very good, the
water is, as a rule, near the surface, and the wells are lined with

<h4><span class="sc">Wadi El Gab</span>.</h4>

<p class="sch3">(<em>By Col. Colvile, Grenadier Guards,
October</em>, 1884.)</p>

<p>The Wadi El Gab is a sandy khor about 63 miles in length,
running through the trough of a broader and rocky valley. Its
general direction is north-west and south-west. It is inhabited by
the Omatto section of the Kababish tribe, of which Sheikh Fadl Mula
Wad Rekha is the chief. Its most southerly well is Marghum, 30
miles to the west of Khandak, and its most northerly is said to be
20 miles west of Hafir. Its only productions are wood and dates,
both of which are plentiful. Its inhabitants do not appear to own
any great number of camels; those to be seen at the various
settlements being mostly milch nagas and their foals. Goats, which
feed on the mimosa, are plentiful.</p>

<p>On leaving the Nile at Bakri the road at first crosses a flat
sandy desert, destitute of vegetation; but after 7 miles a district
is reached, thickly studded with low mimosa bushes. In the district
are several Arab encampments, some of them as much as 4 hoursâ
journey from the nearest water. Fifteen miles from Bakri the
country becomes more undulating, and the surface covered with firm
gravel; and 10 miles further on, a range of hills running north and
south is reached. Passing through a break in this range, the road
follows for 3 miles a valley running nearly at right angles to the
main one, and then strikes the track running down the Gab to the
Abu Gussi-Kordofan road. Passing down a sandy valley, dotted with
sand dunes, and sparsely studded with low mimosa scrub, the most
southerly well, Bir Marghum, is reached, 7 miles north of the point
where the valley first entered. The well is stone-lined, and the
water is 20 feet below the surface and 4 feet deep. It is said that
the well never runs dry; the water is good. For the next 6 miles
the country continues to be scantily covered with low mimosa scrub;
Bir El Ain is then reached, and the valley becomes more thickly and
heavily wooded, and continues to be studded with fine acacia timber
to El Sawani. Between El Ain and El Sawani are the following six
wells:â</p>

<tr>
<td>El Bab.</td>
<td>Bayuda.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>El Huffera.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>They are all lined with stone, and about 4 feet of good water is
found in each of them at from 3 to 4 feet below the surface. Nine
miles beyond El Huffera, El Sawani, the chief settlement of this
section of the Kababish, is reached. It contains many native huts
and four mud dwellings. This well, like all the others (with the
exception of El Marghum) is marked by a clump of palms.</p>

<p>The road to El Ordi, after skirting the valley for a few miles
in a north-east direction, turns to the east and crosses 10 miles
of broken rocky ground and low ridges. A tract of undulating ground
is then reached, which extends to El Ordi. With the exception of
small patches of acacia in some of the valleys, this district is
wholly devoid of vegetation; it is uninhabited.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Wadi El Gab</span>.</h4>

<p class="sch3">(<em>By Colonel A. Hunter, C.B., D.S.O.,
November</em>, 1896.)</p>

<p>The Gab does not realise expectation, nor fulfil the
descriptions given of it. The hand and sand of destruction is
everywhere visible. The wind, blowing prevalently north or
north-west, rolls the sand along, the sand catches in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> tamarisk
bushes, in the roots and undergrowth of the palms, date and dom,
till it piles over the bushes, and reaches towards the top of the
palms or smothers them. The whole place has the appearance of a
forest after a heavy storm: trees lying prone in all directions,
but no effort is made at replanting or replacing. A few seedlings
struggle into existence now and then. The sand moves on, leaving
the palms crippled or dead. I have heard so much of the vegetation
and grazing, and date trees, verdure, luxuriance, etc., of the Wadi
El Gabâit never existed. Ruthless, and judging by events, not
altogether unavoidable, neglect, has diminished the little there
ever was. We know it carried a large head of camels, goats, and
sheep, at least so it was supposed; but, barring goats and a few
donkeys, the herds of the Kababish had to roam âfor forty days in
the wildernessâ towards Darfur and Kordofan, and northwards to
abreast Mahass and Sukkot, for their food. Water is found at from
12 to 20 feet below the surface; the Gab averages about 5 miles in
breadth, patches of grass and thorn bush crop up at intervals,
separated by rolling hills of rock and sand. Round the wells there
are the miserable straw huts and mud houses of the tribesmen, with
here and there groves of palms; no game to speak of. Gazelle exist
in small numbers, and are very afraid of mankind. This is accounted
for by the fact that the Arabs trap them, and hunt them with dogs,
a breed of yellow greyhound. The trap is a round hoop, with thin
strips of wood tied to the circumference, and the points of the
strips meet at the centre, laid so that the strips make a slight
cone, like the top of a basket. The gazelle browse on the thorn
bushes; close to the bush the Arab puts the trap in a little hollow
in the sand, cone downwards, places on the rim of the trap a
running noose, to the other end of which is fastened a billet of
wood. The whole is covered over with sand. The gazelle comes to
feed off the sprouts of the bush; puts his foot into the noose; his
foot slides through the apex of the spines of split wood; he kicks
to free his foot, and so the noose tightens on his leg, and there
he is, with a rope tied to his leg; he cannot kick off the rope,
for the billet of wood drags the knot tight, and the trap prevents
it slipping down, and the Arab then appears with his dogs, and
chases the animal down.</p>

<p>Twelve miles west of Shemsi is Wadi El Butta, very much like the
Gab in appearance. Addax and wild sheep are said occasionally to
come here in summer. Water is near the surface, and is got by the
animals by scraping. A curious feature is the occurrence over the
whole face of the desert of patches of succulent plants and grasses
which serve as food for camels and for goats.</p>

<p>Sawani to Bayuda, 9 miles. El Bab to Haweiya, 9Â½ miles.</p>

<p>At Haweiya, or Haweid, a number of wells, also at El Bab. They
are part and parcel of one place.</p>

<p>Rode to El Marghum, the post occupied by the old Sheb post. I
asked about these wells in the Gab, and got always the same answer.
Those existing were dug by their ancestors, so long ago no one
remembers, and ever since no one has been to the trouble to dig or
explore for anything fresh. Well here deep, 18 or 20 feet, and
stone faced.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">The Wadi El Gab</span>.</h4>

<p class="sch3">(<em>Sir W. Garstin G.C.M.G., April</em>,
1897.)</p>

<p>No account of the Dongola province would be complete without
some mention of this great depression which extends through the
Western Desert from Hafir to Debba, a distance of some 125 miles.
It is chiefly inhabited by the Kababish tribe of Arabs, who use it
for grazing their flocks; and it contains numerous wells.</p>

<p>It has been thought that this depression might possibly be
utilised as a storage reservoir or as a means for escaping the
surplus water in an excessive flood. It is very doubtful whether it
could thus be made use of. The wadi appears really to come to an
end a few miles north of Hafir, and the nearest point to the river
to be at a distance of some 10 miles.</p>

<p>The lowest portions of the Wadi El Gab must be considerably
lower than the level of the river in flood, but by how much it is
impossible, without levels, to say.</p>

<p>On leaving the Nile, in the direction of this valley, the
country rises rapidly for some 4 miles. It then begins to fall away
from the river, in a succession of terraces, until a total of about
10 miles have been traversed. The real edge of the wadi then
commences. Its width at the northern end appears to be about 5
miles. The western edge is filled up with drift sand, which is
gradually covering the palm trees. A well, measured at the Oasis of
Lagia, showed the water level to be some 9 feet below the ground
surface. The water was sweet and of good quality.</p>

<p>It would be useful to have the whole of this depression
carefully levelled and surveyed. The area covered by it is very
large, and supposing it were possible to fill it with water, the
loss from evaporation would certainly be very great.</p>

G. Kilgour and Mr. Fowler, C.E.</em>, 1871-72, <em>and other
Sources.</em>)</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Northern Bayuda Desert.</span>The track
across the Bayuda Desert, from Ambugol to Shendi, is comparatively
easy going, and is fairly well supplied with water; but not being a
main trade route, it is little used by caravans.</p>

<p>There are no difficult defiles or passes.</p>

<p>The tract of country traversed consists of extensive plains
divided by ranges of low hills. It is very unlike the sterile and
rocky deserts further north, and in many places shows abundant
signs of vegetation. Wadis, pastures of long coarse grass, and many
clusters of trees are met with, whilst, during the rainy season,
the ground is susceptible of profitable cultivation in some
parts.</p>

<p>This route is just within the limits of the tropical rains. The
wet season lasts from May to August, but rain never falls for more
than 15 days in any year. Sometimes there is no rain for two
consecutive years.</p>

<p>There are no streams, the water sinking into the sand and
disappearing within 24 hours after rain has fallen.</p>

<p>During exceptionally hot days small whirlwinds pass in great
numbers, and carry across the desert sand and fine debris in
columns upwards of 150 feet in height. They have a formidable
appearance, but are really almost harmless. A very large one might
upset a tent, but this performance represents their maximum
effect.</p>

<p>The Bayuda Desert is inhabited merely by wandering Arab tribes,
of whom the principal are the Hawawir, Hassania, the Sauarab, the
Fadnia, and the Aonia.</p>

<p>They subsist almost entirely by keeping flocks of sheep and
goats, and by breeding camels, wandering from spot to spot to the
best herbage, at such distance from the wells as enables them to
water their animals. They also trap the gazelleâso plentiful in
this desert; and after the rains a certain amount of ground is
usually cultivated by them, and small crops are obtained.</p>

<p>About 4 miles above Ambugol the wadi (valley or stream course)
Abu Gir debouches into the Nile; this wadi takes its rise in the
Jebel Gilif about 70 miles from the Nile; water is obtainable from
shallow wells along its entire course in its bed; like most of the
lower portions of the Bayuda Desert, it is thickly covered with
vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vegetation.</span>This consists
principally of low âsamrâ bushes (spreading thorny acacia),
occasional âsuntâ trees (<i>acacia arabica</i>, 20 to 25 feet
high), the milk plant (<i>asclepia gigantea</i>), the âmarakhâ (a
green shrub), the âtundubâ (a bush, some 15 feet high,), and
âhegligâ trees (20 to 25 feet high, and often with a diameter of
trunk at 5 feet from the ground of 12 to 15 inches), the âmokertâ
(<i>salvadora persica</i>), and even occasionally the âdomâ palm
(<i>hyphÃ¦ne thebaica</i>), of which the âdomâ palm, the âusher,â
and âmarakhâ are indicative of water close to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Firewood.</span>Best suited for firewood
are the âsunt,â the âsamr,â the âtundub,â and the âheglig,â the
wood of the latter, I may mention, being used as the base on which
the natives twirl a dry piece of âsamrâ root with the object of
producing fire.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Food for camels.</span>Camels devour
eagerly the younger branches of the âsamr,â the succulent leaves of
the marakh (camel thorn) and el gau (camel grass), both of the
last-mentioned being plentiful in the Bayuda; indeed, this is a
favourite district for breeding and rearing hagins (the lighter and
faster class of camels).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sheep.</span>Sheep, of which large flocks
are owned by the Hassania, Aonia, and other wandering Bedawi tribes
of the Bayuda, find, during the dry season even, ample food in the
grasses of the plains near Jebel Gilif; whilst the fresher shoots
of the marakh and tundub, with the juicy leaves of the usher,
provide sustenance for the goats.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Route from Ambugol.</span>The readiest
route from Ambugol is to strike for the desert close to the town,
whence an easy slope, some 2 miles in length, rises to the desert
plateau, here some 50 feet above the Nile bank. A shingly level
plain is then traversed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_209">[209]</span> for about 3 miles, when the Wadi Abu Gir is
struck, leading right up to Jebel Gilif, with an ascent of about 10
feet per mile.</p>

<p>The route now skirts the hill Jebel Abu Shenkawi, near to the
salt diggings, and passing another clump of hills, Debba El Kebir,
joins another camel route from the Nile at a point some 300 miles
from Ambugol, where the Wadi Mofokakart debouches into the Wadi Abu
Gir.</p>

<p>This other camel track, after leaving Ambugol, follows the Nile
to near Korti, a distance of some 4 miles, then, turning sharply to
the right, passes by the Wadi Um Marra, and crossing the ridge of
Nasaib El Ruchan, at a point some 300 feet above Ambugol, descends
over rather broken ground to the Wadi Abu Gir, and from this point
there is but one route. At about 37 miles from Ambugol the
<span class="sidenote">First wells.</span>first wells are met;
these are merely holes scooped in the sand, deepened as the
subterranean waters fall, until either the sides fall in, or the
whole of the excavations are obliterated by the rush of water down
the wadi during the rainy season.</p>

<p>The water is drawn from these, and all similar wells in the
Bayuda, by means of a rude skin bag; it is then poured into earth
cisterns, on the surface, at which the camels, sheep etc., drink.
It is so pure that a small quantity of salt, fairly plentiful in
this desert, is mixed with it.</p>

<p>The wadi at this point, about 38 miles from Ambugol, which has
hitherto been flat and sandy, with gently sloping sides, becomes
much broken. Small metamorphic ridges, hills, and lava-like mounds
close in, and petrified wood is strewn in all directions, showing
that the belt of metamorphic rock that intervenes between the lower
Nubian sandstone and the extensive granite rocks is being
traversed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Haweiyat wells.</span>About 55 miles
from Ambugol are the wells of El Haweiyat, of similar character to
those described above; the plain of El Rechewa is left on the
right, and quitting the Wadi Abu Gir, which turns abruptly to the
left, the route crosses a curious plain, about 3 to 4 miles wide,
called <span class="sidenote">El Mesalima.</span>El Mesalima. This
plain is surrounded by low hills, and without vegetation; it is
intersected by veins of mountain limestone, much resembling marble,
and I here found fossil remains of the Saurian type.</p>

<p>Leaving El Mesalima, the route now crosses the plain at the
southern foot of the Jebel Gilif, passing across watercourses
which, in the rainy season, carry off the drainage from the
mountains. These streams issue from wild gorges, and are said to
drain extensive plains, 20 or 30 miles distant; a statement
corroborated by the fact that they bring with them much brushwood
and small timber.</p>

<p>After issuing from the gorges these streams wander at will,
cutting constant new channels over an irregular talus of boulders
and debris they bring with them; at the foot of this talus, they
collect and run down defined sandy channels from 1 to 3 miles long,
whose permanent character is proved by their tree-covered banks;
these large channels then break up into a number of smaller
diverging channels, which lose themselves in a grass-covered plain
to the south, fairly covered with trees and brushwood, and about 8
miles across; this plain is said to be covered with water during
the rains to a depth of 3 or 4 feet.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abu Halfa wells.</span>Water may be
procured in any of these sandy channels by digging holes as
described above; and at Abu Halfa, about 90 miles from Ambugol, are
large wells of this description, at which large numbers of camels
and flocks are daily watered.</p>

<p>After passing numerous pools of water still standing in basins
worn out of the granite bed, the gorge, at a distance of some 7 or
8 miles from the entrance, widened out into a valley about Â½ mile
across; here there was a small lake, the edges fringed with
bulrushes and dom palms, whilst the native huts, flocks, and even
birds and conies showed the permanent character of the lake. I
heard that many similar lakes exist in the recess of the Jebel
Gilif, but the Arabs are extremely reticent on this point.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Jebel Gilif range.</span>At about 79
miles from Ambugol the Jebel Gilif range, with its uniform
precipitous face, breaks up into outlying spurs with intermediate
plains. In one of these spurs, about 2 miles to the north of the
route and 100 miles from Ambugol, are situate the <span class=
"sidenote">Jakdul wells.</span>wells of Jakdul; these consist of
water-worn basins in the bottom of a granite gorge of similar
character to those mentioned above. The largest of the pools is
some 60 yards long and 10 yards broad, and it is stated never to
have run dry.</p>

<p>The water is sweet, but the lower pools are much contaminated by
the flocks constantly using them, and the sight of thousands of
beetles issuing from the water at dusk is not inviting.</p>

<p>The upper pools, however, are much cleaner, and with care an
ample supply of excellent water might be ensured.</p>

<p>No doubt there are many other reservoirs up this gorge as at Abu
Halfa.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Faar wells.</span>To the eastward of
the wells of Jakdul, and about 8 miles from the camel track, are
the wells of El Faar, consisting of holes dug in a sandy
water-channel similar to those of the Wadi Abu Gir.</p>

<p>With Jebel Gilif the granite rocks are left, and the route
traverses the upper Nubian sandstone, simple and metamorphic, to
the river at Shendi, or rather Metemma.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">115th to 125th mile.</span>Between the
115th and 125th mile the route crosses a belt of drift-sand hills
travelling from east to west, these are of the usual type,
<em>i.e.</em>, a crescent presenting its convex side and gentle
slope to the wind; up this slope the sand<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_210">[210]</span> is driven to the apex, whence, falling over
and remaining at its natural angle of repose on the concave side,
the hill gradually but surely advances, the highest of the sand
hills in this locality are about 13 feet high, their rate of
progress depending entirely on the strength of the wind; to a camel
they are no obstacle as it winds amongst them at will.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abu Klea or Tleh wells.</span>At 150
miles from Ambugol are the wells of Abu Klea, or strictly speaking
Abu Tleh (Tleh equals a particular kind of grass), artificial pits
of similar character to those already described; the water is good
and rarely fails; they require of course frequent cleaning out.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shebakat wells.</span>At Shebakat, near
the 168th mile, is a large well about 12 feet in diameter, sunk to
a depth of 50 feet through the sandstone to a bed of water-bearing
gravel; the water is brackish but the supply perennial.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Metemma.</span>At 175 miles from Ambugol,
Metemma is reached; the town is about 1 mile from the Nile, but the
plain between is occasionally flooded. The water supply is from
wells kept up by percolation from the river, and is therefore
excellent.</p>

<p>Hence to Khartoum, as stated above, the river is navigable for
nearly the entire year, <em>vide</em> <a href="#p1c10">Chap.
X.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rainy season.</span>The rainy season in
the Bayuda Desert is uncertain, as this is the extreme northern
range of the tropical monsoon; there may be showers in May, but the
true rains fall in June, July, or August. Some years may pass
without any at all, and then a perfect deluge floods the country
and refills the pools and wells.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>The conformation of the
Jebel Gilif is such, that notwithstanding the large amount of water
running off during the rains, a considerable quantity is stored at
high levels, gradually finding its way into the sand-filled wadis,
through permeable granite augites and diorites, of which Jebel
Gilif is composed.</p>

<p>These wadis are crossed at intervals by spurs of trap rock, that
serve the double purpose of keeping up the level of the wadi, which
would otherwise rapidly degrade, and of affording, so to speak,
âartesianâ vents, up which the water, confined between the beds of
the âNubianâ sandstone below, finds its way into the loose sand
above. In <span class="sidenote">Sinking wells.</span>sinking
wells, spots should be selected where the vegetation in the wadis
is of a brighter hue, and where heglig and the dom palm exist. In
December, 1871, water was found in many such places, never more
than 15 feet below the surface. The trap dyke in the vicinity will
provide any quantity of fairly bedded stone with which to line the
sandy sides of the well; the way I should suggest, would be, in the
first place, to dig through the sand until water be reached, and
then to excavate the ground in a circle of say, 24 feet diameter,
lining it with a dry stone wall 3 feet in thickness, in this should
be built, at intervals, pieces of hard wood, of which there is a
large quantity, in order to form a rude ladder; as soon as the
water is reached, a Nortonâs tube pump should be driven some 6 feet
or more; this will prevent the accumulation of insect life, to be
found in any open pools in the vicinity, and prevent other
pollution; then, when this runs dry, the excavation should be again
carried down to the lowering water level, and a well of internal
diameter of 14 feet be built with a dry stone wall of say, 2 feet
thick (the word in India for this form of well is âbutchaâ), the
Norton tube driven down, and the process repeated as the waters
lower. Were it possible to procure lime readily, the well might be
sunk from the top, as is so habitually done in India, but the only
limestone found in the Bayuda is at the plain of El Mesalima, as
mentioned above.</p>

<p>The stone near these wells, and of which as described above, the
supply will be practically unlimited, may be used in constructing
defensive works, whilst there will be in their neighbourhood large
quantities of fuel, and a considerable amount of bush that will
serve as fodder for the camels.</p>

<p>A considerable quantity of sheep, milk, etc., may be procured
from the neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Jebel Gilif.</span>The Jebel Gilif
presents a certain source of danger (during the expedition, 1884):
this consists of, in places, an almost precipitous face of some
hundreds of feet in height, at the foot is an irregular talus
formed by the degradation of the face, and by the stones and
boulders brought down the âkhorsâ (ravines) with which it is
intersected. These âkhorsâ are, in many places, near their
debouchure from the mountains, very narrow (in places only one
camel can pass at a time), with steeply precipitous sides, the
bottom being of granite rock, polished by the materials carried
down in the torrents of the rainy season, and in many places half
blocked up with boulders and <em>dÃ©bris</em>. As these âkhorsâ rise
to the level of the range they widen out into valleys, well
supplied with wood, water, forage, etc., where large numbers of men
could be kept concealed for a considerable period.</p>

<h4><a id="p1c09b"></a><em>Report on El Ein.</em>
</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Situation.</span>El Ein is situated about
130 miles from Debba up the Wadi El Melh. The general trend up the
wadi is S.S.W. At El Ein on the western bank, for some 60 miles
northwards and a short distance southwards, is a precipitous
escarpment of rugged outline, but extremely uniform in height,
known as Jebel Makakush. El Ein is a gorge in this, the northern
promontory of which is surmounted by a rock of curious shape and is
called El Serg.</p>

<p>There are two places where water is obtainable along the route
from Debba to El Ein, one called Mahtul about 30 miles from Debba
has two wells, and the other is Soteir another 30 miles further on.
The latter is the better<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> water, but the quantity is small. On the
arrival of the writer the well had been emptied by watering a troop
of camels, and his men stated there was not enough water to fill
waterskins for from two to three hours. At El Ein there is good and
abundant water, while grazing may be found almost anywhere along
the Wadi El Melh, but from about 30 miles south of Soteir it lies
only along the western side, and is much less abundant than further
north.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Geology.</span>The formation at El Ein is
a series of undisturbed sedimentary beds lying horizontally, most
of which are sandstones or grits. This overlies unconformably a
much older series of gneisses and schists which are exposed in the
lower parts of the Wadi El Melh along the foot of the Makakush
escarpment a few miles north of El Ein.</p>

<p>The sandstone series is continuous all the way to Debba, and
extends over very large tracts of the Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mineral deposits.</span>There are no
indications of any mineral deposits of value at El Ein in any of
the beds exposed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Old workings.</span>At several points,
especially along the sides and just above the stream-bed, there are
natural caves in the sandstone. For some little distance a very
soft underlying bed has been weathered away undermining a harder
upper one, the unsupported portions of which have broken off and
fallen, or cracked and bent over, leaving open gashes. The general
appearance of all this very much resembles that of an ancient shaft
nearly filled up with <em>dÃ©bris</em>, though a careful examination
leaves no doubt that the phenomena are natural.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ancient buildings.</span>On either side
of the gorge about opposite the well is a cluster of ancient
houses, while on a hill some way up the gorge and on the south side
are some five more.</p>

<p>The houses are all of similar design approximately round, and
are well built, without mortar, of unhewn stone laid in courses;
the walls are about 2 feet thick, and many of the stones are of
great size. The doorways of most of them face down the valley, but
a few are on the opposite side. Many have additional rooms built
forming segments of circles.</p>

<p>These buildings are more substantial, and differ in other
respects from those usually seen round ancient mines in the Sudan.
The only implements noted were two crushing stones; these, however,
have not been used for crushing quartz (the matrix in which gold
usually lies), being of ordinary millstone and not hard enough for
that purpose. They were in all probability only the usual stones
for crushing grain.</p>

<p>Across the entrance to the gorge is a wall probably originally 6
to 8 feet high, but now in ruins. It is built of unhewn stones,
fairly well coursed, without mortar. The sides are vertical. This
runs across the flat space at the entrance to the gorge and a
little way up the northern slope. The stream bed lies in a creek
some 15 feet below the level of the ground on which the wall
stands, and there is no evidence of this waterway ever having been
blocked.</p>

<p>In view of this as well as of the general construction of the
wall, it is impossible that the structure was a dam, but I should
imagine it was probably built for defence, and the gorge was used
as a place of refuge against marauding bands by a people whose
flocks usually grazed in the valley below.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c10s1"></a><span class="sc">Section
1.âRailways</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Historical.</span>To Said Pasha (1860) is
due the first idea of connecting the Sudan by railway with Lower
Egypt. Mougel Bey reported on the subject, but, owing to the
expense involved, the project was abandoned.</p>

<p>The first attempt at actually laying a railway in the Sudan
dates from the time of the Khedive Ismail Pasha.</p>

<p>After a preliminary study in 1865-66, by Messrs. Walker and
Bray, the Khedive sent up, in 1871, Mr. J. Fowler, C.E., to settle
on the best routes for putting the Sudan into railway communication
with civilisation. After some time spent in preliminary surveys,
Mr. Fowler decided on a line which, starting from Halfa, would run
up the eastern Nile bank, cross the river about Amara, and roughly
follow the left bank to Ambugol. From here it would strike across
the Bayuda desert, <em>viÃ¢</em> Jakdul, to Metemma, cross the river
again here, and continue along the right bank to Khartoum
North.</p>

<p>From Debba a line was to be laid direct to El Fasher, capital of
Darfur.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Sudan, meanwhile, a line was to be laid from
Suakin, <em>viÃ¢</em> Sinkat, to cross the Atbara and strike the
Nile opposite to Khartoum.</p>

<p>These routes were accurately surveyed, and the railway from
Halfa was actually begun and carried along the right bank to about
Sarras. It was then abandoned, partly for financial reasons and
partly at the desire of General Gordon, who considered that the
country was not yet ripe for works involving such a considerable
outlay.</p>

<p>During the 1884-85 expedition the railway was continued for some
40 miles, but in consequence of the evacuation of the Sudan it was
dropped, and the portion beyond Sarras was destroyed by the
Dervishes.</p>

<p>In 1896, when operations became imminent, the Sirdar began
laying a line from Korosko southwards, but this was soon abandoned,
and the original railway was continued in April, 1896, in the
direction of Dongola. This line was completed after considerable
difficulties, as far as its present terminus, Kerma, on 4th April,
1897.</p>

<p>The main line, striking from Halfa across the desert to Abu
Hamed, was commenced on 1st January, 1897, and, after a stoppage of
22 days for want of material, reached Abu Hamed, 230 miles, on 31st
October, 1897. It was laid at the great rate of about a mile a day,
the maximum speed for one day being 5,200 yards. The record for 1
month was 48 miles; this was during October, 1897.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>It eventually
reached Khartoum North (Halfaya) on the last day of 1899.</p>

<p>The Suakin-Berber railway was boldly taken in hand during the
Suakin expedition in the spring of 1885, but only a few miles were
laid, and it was then abandoned.</p>

<p>The route for the future Nile-Red Sea railway has now been
decided on and surveyed (1902-03), and the laying has been
commenced from both ends.</p>

<p>The present lines from Halfa to Khartoum North and Dongola
(Kerma) were laid primarily to supply an army in the field; the
route, method of laying, and materials, were all chosen with this
object in view.</p>

<p>Partly as a consequence of this, nearly 50 per cent. of the line
is in the desert.</p>

<p>The main line is 575 miles, and the Kerma line is 203 miles
long.</p>

<p>The gauge of the lines is 3 feet 6 inches, the same as the Cape
railways. Single line throughout (except at the
crossing-places).</p>

<p>Goods trains on the Khartoum line have to carry 7,000 gallons of
water to enable them to cross the waterless desert sections; this
considerably reduces the useful carrying power of the line.</p>

<p>The Kerma line runs through very rocky country, and has sharp
curves and steep gradients. It is liable to washouts, and, as its
cost is prohibitive in proportion to the traffic receipts, it will
be abandoned in December, 1904, and the Dongola Province will be
later connected to the main line by a branch line to Abu Hamed.</p>

<p>Khartoum line, steepest gradient 1 in 125; sharpest curve 960
feet radius.</p>

<p>Kerma line, steepest gradient, 1 in 50; sharpest curve 500 feet
radius.</p>

<p>The Nile-Red Sea line will leave the main line about the mouth
of the Atbara, will run up this river to about Khor Hudi (15
miles), and then branch off north-eastwards over the desert to
Suakin, <em>viÃ¢</em> Sinkat Pass. It is now in course of
construction, and should be finished by the summer of 1906. Besides
this and the Abu Hamed-Merowe branch, which is to be shortly
commenced, other projected railway extension is from Omdurman to El
Obeid, Suakin to Kassala, and Khartoum (N.) to opposite Wad
Medani.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c10s2"></a><span class="sc">Section 2.âRiver
Communications</span>.</h3>

<p>The Sudan freight, passenger, and postal communications are
carried out by river from Shellal to Halfa, Kerma to Merowe on the
Dongola reach, and to stations south of Khartoum by steamers and
sailing boats.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Shellal-Halfa (226 Miles</span>).</h4>

<p>On the Shellal-Halfa reach for this purpose are five stern-wheel
steamers, 2 screw tugs, 11 troop barges, 8 sailing barges
(including one of 500 tons carrying capacity), and 44 sailing
gayassas belonging to the Sudan Government; there are also about
110 gayassas on hire for carriage of supplies, stores, etc.</p>

<p>A fast steamer service twice a week for through mails and
passengers runs in connection with the Egyptian and Sudan railway
services. This service is carried out by two steamers.</p>

<p>A slow service for local mails and passengers and freight also
runs twice weekly.</p>

<p>The steamer passenger service carries private passengers, but no
private freight is taken either by Government steamers or sailing
boats. This is taken by private companies, Messrs. Thos. Cook,
etc.</p>

<p>Arrangements are made to load both ordinary passengers and cargo
at North End, Aswan, and for steamers and boats to pass through the
dam locks. The fast mail steamers start from above (<em>i.e.</em>,
south of) the dam.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>â<span class=
"sc">Dongola Reachâ (222 Miles between 3rd and 4th
Cataracts</span>).</h4>

<p>On the Dongola reach there are two stern-wheel steamers, two
troop barges, and 15 sailing gayassas belonging to the Government;
some small nuggars are also being built for the use of
districts.</p>

<p>One steamer is for the use of the Mudir, and the other runs a
fortnightly service between Dongola and Merowe during low Nile, and
from Kerma to Merowe when the river permits.</p>

<p>The river between Kerma and Dongola is always navigable for
lightly-loaded steamers, but when the river is low there are one or
two dangerous rocky places, and it is not considered advisable to
run a regular service. This portion is therefore principally
navigated by sailing boats during this period.</p>

<p>Steamers and sailing boats are available for the carriage of
private passengers and goods.</p>

<p>The river is only navigable a short distance upstream of Merowe
at certain times of the year.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Khartoum and South</span>.</h4>

<p>There are three screw and seven stern-wheel armed gun-boats; the
latter being frequently used for transport work. The screw boats
are kept as station âguard shipsâ at the southernmost Blue and
White Nile posts and at Khartoum. In addition to the gunboats there
are five stern-wheel steamers and one new paddle steamer of about
100 to 120 feet long for post, passenger and freight service. For
local work or special duty there are four very old paddle steamers
of Gordonâs time, two screw tugs, and four launches, as well as 20
barges capable of carrying troops, animals, and freight.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Regular services.<a id=
"FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a></span>A monthly service, 13 days, runs to
Gondokoro, the most northerly Nile post of Uganda, leaving Khartoum
on the 15th, and returning from Gondokoro for the north about the
29th of each month, arriving at Khartoum about the 10th.</p>

<p>This steamer calls at all intermediate stations south of Goz Abu
Guma.</p>

<p>A monthly service (9 days) runs up the Bahr El Ghazal to Wau and
Meshra El Rek, or as near as the state of the river will allow,
leaving Khartoum on the 1st of each month; starting on the return
journey on the 12th, and arriving at Khartoum about the 19th. These
steamers also call at all intermediate stations south of Goz Abu
Guma.</p>

<p>The weekly service from Khartoum every Tuesday to Goz Abu Guma
and intermediate stations, returning on Sundays, is now carried out
by the private company below-mentioned.</p>

<p>A steamer runs occasionally up the Sobat, as required, between
the middle of May and end of December.</p>

<p>A steamer runs twice a day between Omdurman, Khartoum, and
Khartoum North. A chain-steam-ferry also connects Khartoum and
Khartoum North.</p>

<p>The Blue Nile is open for navigation by steamer only for about
six months of the year (beginning of June to beginning of
December), and a fortnightly service leaving Khartoum every
alternate Wednesday then runs to Wad Medani and back. From there to
Roseires a monthly service is maintained.</p>

<p>The stern-wheel post steamers have each 8 to 10 cabins, and are
capable of towing two double-decked troop barges each. They can
then take 300 or 400 troops each, or about 80 tons of freight.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the transport of supplies, stores,
building materials, etc., is carried in sailing boats (nuggars and
gayassas), of which the Government owns 125. They are generally of
from 10 to 50 tons carrying capacity each.</p>

<p>Private passengers and freight are carried by the steamers;
boats and occasionally steamers can be hired when available.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Non-Government steamers.</span>Two
steamers (stern-wheel) and seven steel barges have been put on the
river at and south of Khartoum by a private company (The Sudan
Development and Exploration Company), and carry passengers and
freight.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Native boats.</span>The native sailing
boat, called nuggar, is found all along the Nile in considerable
numbers. It varies in size, from a capacity of a few ardebs to that
of about 200 ardebs (25 tons). These boats are very strongly built
of thick hard timber, occasionally half-decked, and fitted with one
mast and lateen sails, and very long oars, mostly crooked. They are
not so high in the bows nor as graceful as the Lower Nile boats
(gayassas). They are mostly employed in carrying grain or gum. The
chief native boat-building yards are at Omdurman, Dueim, and Goz
Abu Guma, and on the Blue Nile at Senga.</p>

<p>Small and cumbrous rafts, rowed by one or two men, are sometimes
seen; these are mostly used for carrying timber.</p>

<p>The ambach canoe, composed of a thick bundle of that pith-like
cane tied together, turned up at the bows, and propelled by a
paddle, is seen up the White Nile, and in the higher reaches,
dug-out canoes, holding from one to six men, are used, both for
transport and for hunting purposes.</p>

<p>A still more primitive method of water transport is that of
inflated skins, or empty jars with the mouth closed by a skin.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span><span class=
"sc">Red Sea</span>.</h4>

<p>The Sudan Government owns a steamer of 420 tons, the âMukhbir,â
which plies between Suez and Suakin at irregular intervals as
occasion requires.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c10s3"></a><span class="sc">Section
3.âRoads</span>.</h3>

<p>The Sudan is almost entirely flat, except along its eastern
frontier and in parts of Southern Kordofan, S. Bahr El Ghazal, and
Darfur. Theoretically it should be possible to traverse it from end
to end without difficulty, for it is almost everywhere good âgoingâ
for animals, though not for wheeled transport; but practically
communication is everywhere limited by questions of wells and water
supply, in many parts by the presence of thick and thorny bush, and
in some parts by swamps.</p>

<p>The animal which is the most suitable for each district of the
Sudan naturally varies according to the locality. Roughly, it may
be said that north of the 12th parallel the camel is the most
useful animal. On the hilly slopes of the Abyssinian plateau the
mule and donkey are indispensable, and these are also employed in
the Bahr El Ghazal (<em>vide</em> <a href="#p1c07">Chap. VII</a>).
In Southern Kordofan bulls are used for riding, and a certain
amount of stuff is carried on pack-oxen; whilst in the low-lying,
as well as in the hilly, districts of the Upper Nile human
porterage is employed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Horses.</span>The horse is bred and used
for riding purposes in Southern Kordofan, in parts of the Dongola
province, and in the northern part of the Gezira between the White
and Blue Niles, but, probably owing to his inability to travel long
distances without water, is not thickly distributed any where, and
a really good one is rarely to be purchased. Some Abyssinian ponies
and country-breds are to be had near that border, price Â£E.4 to
Â£E.5. The principal horse-owning tribes in the Sudan at present are
the Homr and Messeria Baggara in south-west Kordofan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Camels.</span>The great breeding-grounds
of the camel are to be found in the desert between the Nile (north
of Berber) and the Red Sea; and in the Kababish and other country
in Southern Dongola, in the Hadendoa country, and in Northern
Kordofan. In these districts a very fine stamp of camel is
produced, much lighter, faster, and better-bred-looking than the
slow, heavy transport camel of Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>Thousands of camels are bred in these parts and owned by the
various nomadic tribes; but it is not easy to obtain them in large
numbers, for the owners are, as a rule, disinclined to sell.</p>

<p>The camels of the Kababish and neighbouring tribes are fully
engaged in the transport of gum and dates, and in other parts
constitute the sole wealth of their owners, who will not part
except at comparatively high prices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>The price varies
from Â£E.9 in the Kassala and Suakin districts to Â£E.15 in the
Dongola province, and fancy prices are sometimes paid for
particularly good riding camels.</p>

<p>Average cost of camel hire PT.8 to PT.12 per diem, including
baggage saddle, head rope, forage, and attendant.</p>

<p>Price of native riding saddle (maglufa) Â£E.2 to Â£E.5.</p>

<p>Sudan camels easily carry 350 lbs., and occasionally carry up to
500 lbs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mules.</span>Mules are only obtainable
from the Abyssinian borderland, chiefly at Gedaref, Gallabat,
Roseires, and Itang, though, unless plenty of notice is given, not
many are obtainable even at these markets. These mules are small,
but good and hardy, suited to pack transport, though not suitable,
owing to their small size and weight, to draught work. Price, Â£E.5
to Â£E.1O. Can carry 150 to 180 lbs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Donkeys.</span>Donkeys make excellent
transport animals; they can go longer without water than mules.
They are obtainable in most parts of the Sudan, price Â£E.3 to
Â£E.10, or, to hire, PT.5 per diem. The Sudan donkey does for both
riding or baggage work. The Abyssinian donkey is smaller and
cheaper, Â£E.1Â½ to Â£E.3, and better for transport work, especially
in hilly country, being less liable to sore backs, but he generally
permits no one to ride him. Large quantities are to be had in
Gedaref and Gallabat. Can carry 100 to 150 lbs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Oxen.</span>Pack oxen, occasionally used
in Southern Kordofan and the Bahr El Ghazal, can only carry light
weights up to 150 lbs., and are very slow movers. For draught work
they have been so far successfully tried in the Bahr El Ghazal.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Carriers.</span>Human carriers are only
obtainable with difficulty on the Upper Nile and in the Bahr El
Ghazal. They carry 50-lb. loads besides their rations.</p>

<p>Elephants are still a dream of the future as regards pack and
transport work.</p>

<h3><a id="p1c10s5"></a><span class="sc">Section 5.âPosts and
Telegraphs</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Posts.</span>In March, 1897, a Sudan
postal service was commenced. The first office opened was at Halfa
camp, and following in the wake of the Army, offices were opened in
the same year at Kerma, Dongola, Korti, and Merowe, and a regular
bi-weekly mail was established.</p>

<p>In 1898 offices were opened at various places between Berber and
Khartoum, and the postal service was rapidly further extended over
a great part of the Sudan. In February, 1901, the postal and
telegraph services were combined, and the head office was
transferred from Cairo to Khartoum North, and subsequently in 1902
to Khartoum.</p>

<p>There are now 26 post offices in the Sudan open to the money
order service, and a travelling postmaster issues and pays money
orders at stations on the Halfa-Kerma Railway.</p>

<p>There are various other offices open dealing with
correspondence, sale of stamps, and ordinary parcel service
(<em>vide</em> below).</p>

<p>An increasing amount of money passes through the post in the
shape of money orders. In 1902, a total of Â£E.355,000 was paid in
at Sudan offices by the public for transmission, and a total of
Â£E.145,000 was paid out. The figures in 1901 were Â£E.267,500 and
Â£E.107,700 respectively.</p>

<p>Mails in the Sudan are carried by railway, steamers, camels,
donkeys, or runners, according to the locality.</p>

<p>Mail services now extend to Gallabat, Roseires, Gondokoro,
Meshra El Rek, and Nahud.</p>

<p>Mails are exchanged weekly with Eritrea at Sabderat.</p>

<p>(For details of post offices, <em>vide</em> Egyptian Postal
Guide, 1904, p. 175.)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Telegraphs.</span>The telegraph now,
besides connecting with Suakin and Kassala, reaches to Gallabat,
Taufikia (W. Nile), Roseires, and El Obeid. A line from Khartoum
through Geteina and Kawa to Goz Abu Guma is now in course of
construction, and when the Nile-Red Sea Railway is commenced, a
telegraph line will be built along it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1905 a telegraph line will be laid from
Meshra El Rek to Wau, and thence probably <em>viÃ¢</em> Rumbek to
the Bahr El Jebel. Communication between Meshra and Taufikia is to
be maintained by oil launches.</p>

<p>Till 1902 white ants were a great source of annoyance, but since
steel bases have been used for telegraph poles this has, to a great
extent, ceased. Creosoted poles also do not appear to be attacked
by them.</p>

<p>Elephant and giraffe in the more southern districts are,
however, likely to continue a somewhat frequent course of
interruption of communication.</p>

<p>A reconnaissance was made in April, 1904, south of Taufikia and
another from El Obeid to Nahud and Foga with a view to further
extensions of the wire. In the winter of 1904-05 the line will be
laid from Meshra Rek to Wau, but there is a great difficulty in
connecting with Taufikia.</p>

<p>There are now 3,074 miles of telegraph line (3,469 miles of
wire), and 35 telegraph offices, in the Sudan (<em>vide</em>
below).</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy has not been lost sight of, but will not be
adopted, at any rate, for the present.</p>

<p>79,500 private telegrams were forwarded from Sudan offices in
1903, as against 57,700 in 1901 and 66,000 in 1902.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Telephones.</span>A telephone system was
established between Khartoum, Omdurman, and Khartoum North, with an
exchange in the Government buildings, Khartoum, in February, 1903.
There are at present 45 offices connected to the exchange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Instruments and
stores have been ordered to extend the system to enable private
subscribers in the towns to be connected. A sub-exchange at
Khartoum North was installed in January, 1904, and another has been
ordered for Omdurman.</p>

<p class="sch">FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE ARAB INVASION
(<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 640).</p>

<p>The name of Ethiopia,<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> or Kush, was applied in
ancient times vaguely to the East African interior south of Egypt,
from about lat. 24Â° to about lat. 9Â°. (The name of Nubia, as
representing the more northern portion of âEthiopia,â say between
the 3rd and the 1st Cataracts, does not appear till Roman times,
but for convenience sake that portion will be so termed in the
following account. It was termed Kenset by the Ancient
Egyptians.)</p>

<p>The whole tract was, as we know, for the most part sandy or
rocky desert, rich in minerals, interspersed with oases, but
contained along the course of the Nile a valuable strip of
territory; while, south and south-east of the point where the Nile
receives the Atbara, it spreads out into a broad and fertile
region, watered by many streams, diversified by hills and
woodlands, and of considerable fertility; of this but little now
remains. This ancient Ethiopia did not, in all probability, include
the present Abyssinia.</p>

<p>At no time did the whole of this vast tractâ1,000 miles long by
800 or 900 broadâform a single state or monarchy. Rather, for the
most part, was it divided up among an indefinite number of states,
or rather of tribes, some of them herdsmen, others hunters or
fishermen, very jealous of their independence, and frequently at
war one with another. Among the various tribes there was a certain
community of race, a resemblance of physical type, and a similarity
of language. Their neighbours, the Egyptians, included them all
under a single ethnic name, speaking of their land as Ta Kes, Kesh,
or Kush, and of the inhabitants as Kashi or Kushiâa term manifestly
identical with the Kush of the Hebrews. They were a race cognate
with the Egyptians, but darker in complexion, and coarser in
feature, not by any means negroes, but still more clearly allied to
the negro than the Egyptians were. Their best representatives in
modern times are believed to be the Gallas and the like, who are
probably their descendants.<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>From the earliest times there appears to have been a constant
infiltration from South Arabia into Abyssinia<a id=
"FNanchor_144b"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a> and the Eastern Sudan; indeed, the dynastic
Egyptians themselves are believed by some high authorities to have
been a Semitic tribe which came over from Arabia, landed somewhere
about Massaua (?), and proceeded northwards along the coast,
leaving colonies as it went, till it struck the valley of the Nile
<em>viÃ¢</em> Kosseir, the Wadi Hammamat, and Kena (or Koptos). Here
they found the Neolithic âNew Race,â and exterminated or expelled
them (?); but it is doubtful how far this New Race extended up the
Nile valley.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 4000
(?).</span>The earliest mention that we have of the land south of
Egypt dates from the time of Snefru (? 3rd or 4th Dynasty), who
conquered the land of the Negroes, and took captive 7,200 men and
women, and 200,000 cattle.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 3400
(?).</span>An inscription of the Fifth Dynasty informs us that King
Assa sent one Ba Ur Tettu to the âLand of Ghosts, which is south of
the land of the Negroes,â to fetch him some Pygmies. The quest was
successful, and is confirmed (?) by some dwarfish skeletons found
in the tombs of that period.</p>

<p>This would seem to show that there were communications, and
possibly even a brisk commerce, between the countries at an even
earlier date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span><span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 3230.</span>In the time of
the Sixth Dynasty Una, a high official under Pepi I, raised
Sudanese levies, natives and negroes, to fight in Eastern Egypt and
Sinai. He also cleared a canal in the 1st Cataract (of which there
are now no traces), and Nubian chiefs, whom he had fought and
conquered five times, brought wood for him. <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 3200.</span>Mer-en-Ra (of
Sixth Dynasty) sent one Her-Khuf three times to Nubia on trading
expeditions, and he returned with ivory, ebony, etc., which would
seem to show that he had penetrated some distance. He reached
Amani, Arerthet, Meskher, Terres, etc., but the locality of these
places is unknown. At this period the Nehesânegroids of the
Sudanâoccupied the country as far north as Aswan; some of their
tribes were termed the Aam, Wauat, etc., the latter living probably
near Korosko.</p>

<p>By the end of the Early Empire, <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2530 (First to Tenth Dynasties), Egyptian armies had certainly
advanced into the Eastern Sudan.</p>

<p>In the Eleventh Dynasty there was regular communication between
Egypt and the debateable land of Punt, and <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2500.</span>we are told
that one Hennu, in the reign of Seankhka, made a trading expedition
thither by sea, <em>viÃ¢</em> Kosseir, for unguents. This is not the
place in which to discuss the position of the land of Punt, but it
seems probable that it lay somewhere in the âhornâ of Africa, and
was not as far south as the Pungwe or Rhodesia, as some have
recently tried to prove.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2460.</span>The next we hear of Nubia is that Amenemhat I (Twelfth
Dynasty) conquered the Wauat and Machaiu Nubians, and then raided
the Libyans to the west; <span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 2430.</span>and 30 years later his son, Usertsen
I, sent an armed caravan under Ameni into Ethiopia and âenlarged
the borders of Egypt between the 1st and 3rd Cataracts.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2366.</span>The Nubians attacked the quarries at Aswan in the
following reign (Usertsen II), but were repelled, and in the next
generation <span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2325.</span>a serious expedition on a large scale was undertaken by
the great Usertsen III. This monarch worked through the canal in
the 1st Cataract, conquered the âabominable Kash,â and at the 2nd
Cataract he set a boundary stone. <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2317.</span>Eight years
later he beat the Kash again, and built the great temples and forts
of Semna and Kumna, 40 miles south of Halfa, to guard the defile of
the Nile. He also issued edicts for the prevention of any natives
from descending the Nile in boats or otherwise, except for the
purpose of trade.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2300.</span>A few years later Amenemhat III cut a Nile gauge in the
rock near Semna, and this is visible to this day. The height of the
Nile flood is curiously enough, marked as being 26 feet higher than
it is now. (This was the monarch who also built the Labyrinth in
the Fayum.)</p>

<p>The statues of Sebek Hetep III on Argo Island probably prove
that the kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty occupied and garrisoned
the present province of Dongola; but for the following 600 years no
further records are available (Hyksos period).</p>

<p>During the Eighteenth Dynasty (<span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1700 to 1400), Ethiopia was a good deal <em>en Ã©vidence</em>.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1700.</span>AmÃ¢sis I invaded Nubia, slaughtered the âAnti of
Kensetâ somewhere south-east of Halfa, and returned; <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1660.</span>Amenophis I
sent punitive expeditions to the Eastern Sudan and took many
prisoners; <span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1630.</span>Thothmes I had a river fight with the Nubians, killed
their king, and fastened his âvile dead bodyâ to the bows of his
boat; he proceeded as far as Kerma (Tombos) and probably beyond,
and set up a Viceroy as Prince of Kush; <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1628.</span>and two years
later he proceeded again thither <em>viÃ¢</em> the canal
above-mentioned, clearing it out on his way. <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1610.</span>A few years
afterwards, Thothmes II raided Nubia severely, killing all males
except âone of the damned sons of the Chief of Kesh,â whom he used
as a footstool. <span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 1600.</span>Under Queen Hatshepset<a id=
"FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class=
"fnanchor">[145]</a> the Nubians paid tribute to Egypt, but
revolted against her successor, the great Thothmes III. This
monarch, however, seems to have crushed them in an expedition
through the 1st Cataract, and to have consolidated the Egyptian
conquests in Ethiopia.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1590.
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1560. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1500.</span>Amenhotep II, son of Thothmes III, again overran Nubia
on a large scale, and his successor, Amenhotep III, extended the
Egyptian frontier to the 4th Cataract and possibly to the Atbara,
building a large temple to Ammon at Napata, which lay close to
Jebel Barkal (the present Merowe) near the foot of the 4th
Cataract.</p>

<p>About this date there was formed a priestly colony at
Napata,<a id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class=
"fnanchor">[146]</a> in close touch with the Egyptian religion, and
forming a strong link between the two countries. Civilization
appears to have greatly increased in the Napata region, but the
Nubians to the north seem to have remained in a barbaric condition,
for we find <span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1400.</span>Rameses I making an expedition against them,
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1333.</span>and the great Rameses II forcing them to pay tribute.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1360.</span>The father of the latter, however, Seti I, as well as
his son, devoted his chief energies in Nubia to erecting temples
and works,<a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class=
"fnanchor">[147]</a> and more particularly to digging for gold,
minerals, and precious stones in the Eastern Desert. Starting from
Kubban, opposite Dakka, Rameses II dug wells in the Wadi Alagi and
other regions and worked gold mines with considerable result. The
warlike operations in these regions of himself and his successors,
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1300.
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1200.</span>Manephtha and Rameses
III, seem to have been chiefly confined to beating the Libyans in
the Western Desert.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hierarchy of Napata was growing in power. The
Ethiopians of this region, a plastic race, adopted<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> to a considerable extent the
Egyptian civilization, worshipped Egyptian gods in Egyptian
shrines, and set up inscriptions in the hieroglyphic character and
in the Egyptian, as well as the Nubian, tongue. Napata and the Nile
valley both below it and above it, was already half Egyptianised
when, on the establishment of the Sheshonk Libyan (Twenty-second)
Dynasty in Egypt (<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 966), <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 966.</span>the descendants
of Herhor of Thebes resolved to quit their native country and
remove themselves into Ethiopia, where they had reason to expect a
welcome. They were probably already connected by marriage with some
of the leading chiefs of Napata, and their sacerdotal character
gave them a great hold on a peculiarly superstitious people.
Retaining their priestly office, they became at once Ethiopian
monarchs, and High Priests of the Temple of Ammon, which Amenhotep
III had erected at Napata. Napata, under their government,
flourished greatly, and acquired a considerable architectural
magnificence. Fresh temples were built, in which the worship of
Egyptian was combined with that of Ethiopian deities; avenues of
sphinxes adorned the approaches to these new shrines; the practice
of burying the members of the royal houses in pyramids was reverted
to, and the necropolis of Napata recalled the glories of the old
necropolis of Memphis.</p>

<p>Napata was also a place of much wealth. The kingdom whereof it
was capital reached southward as far as the modern Khartoum, and
south-eastwards stretched up to the Abyssinian highlands, including
the valleys of the Atbara and its tributaries, together with most
of the tract between the Atbara and the Blue Nile. This was a
region of reputed great natural wealth, containing many mines of
gold, iron, copper, and salt, abundant woods of date palm, almond
trees, and ilex, some excellent pasture ground, and much rich
meadow land suitable for the growth of dura and other sorts of
grain. Fish of many kinds and excellent turtle abounded in the
Atbara and the other streams, while the geographical position was
favourable for commerce with the tribes of the interior, who were
able to furnish an almost inexhaustible supply of ivory, skins, and
ostrich feathers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C</span>
966-800.</span>In course of time the Napata kingdom extended its
sway to Aswan, and even to Thebes. The kings of the
Twenty-second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
(Libyan) Dynasty did not attempt to make Egyptian authority felt
south of Aswan, and at last the Nubian opportunity came.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
760-733.</span>In about 734 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, Piankhi,
King of Napata, seeing the weakened and divided sway of the
Twenty-third Dynasty, chose a favourable moment in the revolt of
Taf Nekht, Prince of Sais and Memphis, swooped down on Egypt,
assaulted and occupied Memphis, and became master of the country.
Bak-en-Renf, sole representative of the Twenty-fourth Dynasty, was
killed; the whole of Egypt, with the exception of a portion of the
Delta, became a province of Ethiopia, <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 730-667.</span>and the
Twenty-fifth Dynasty was composed of Ethiopian princes.</p>

<p>These Kings were named Shabaka (Sabaco), Shabataka, and Taharka
(Tirhakah), the latter of which trio delivered <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 700.</span>Hezekiah from
Sennacherib. He was, however, heavily defeated by Esarheddon, son
of the latter, somewhere near Tel-el-Kebir, <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 672.</span>and Egypt was
overrun by the Assyrians.</p>

<p>Fierce fighting continued for the next 20 years between Ethiopia
and Assyria over the prostrate body of Egypt, and the latter was
reduced to utter ruin. <span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 652.</span>Finally Mi-Ammon-Nut, Prince of
Napata, and son (?) of Taharka, partly relieved the country from
the Assyrians, but he had no successors, and died soon
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 650
(?).</span>Psammetichus I (Twenty-sixth Dynasty), of Libyan
descent, finally shook off the Assyrian yoke a few years later. His
connection with Ethiopia is chiefly confined to the fact that a
large number of his troops (200,000 to 240,000, according to
ancient authoritiesâbut this number must be grossly over-stated)
quitted him as a protest against the favouritism shewn to his
foreign (Greek and Lydian) mercenaries, and took service with
Ethiopia. <span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 648
(?).</span>Several versions of this story exist, but no serious
disturbance of the balance of power would seem to have resulted.
Herodotus states that they<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> were given land to the
south of Meroe, in the land of the Macrobii (Sennar?). <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 590 (?).</span>His
descendant Psammetichus II appears to have attacked Ethiopia, and
it is stated that Nebuchadnezzar II, after beating Necho, the
previous king, made a fruitless expedition into Nubia.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
566.</span>As far as can be gathered the following kings of
Ethiopia succeeded Piankhi between about 730 and 525 <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span>; little is known about them except what is given
below:â</p>

<p>Ra Usr Maat.</p>

<p>Mer-Ka-Ra.</p>

<p>Wach-Ka-Ra.</p>

<p>Aspelta, 625 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> Killed a colony of
raw-meat-eaters at Barkal.</p>

<p>Pankhaluru, before 560 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Heru-Sa-Atef, Amen Sa Meri. A great warrior. 560-525
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Nastasenen, 525-517 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> Ruled over
Kenset and the kingdom of Alut (Napata and Soba?); conquered many
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>Between the
years 625 and 560 the capital seems to have been shifted from
Napata to Meroe. The kingdom ruled by these monarchs included Alwa,
a place identified with the later Soba on the Blue Nile. The
connection with Egypt was weakened; Heru-Sa-Atef found the royal
palace at Napata in ruins and restored it; his successor Nastasenen
re-visited it and went on a journey of inspection as far north
probably as the 3rd Cataract, but Meroe was the principal seat of
his kingdom. Nastasenen mentions on his inscription five campaigns,
apparently against the rich pastoral peoples of the Eastern Desert,
from whom he captured in all nearly 2,000,000 head of cattle,
sheep, goats, etc. At Meroe, about 40 miles to the south of the
Atbara, at a place now termed Bagarawiya, were built temples and
pyramids copied from Napata.</p>

<p>It was in his reign that, according to Herodotus, Cambyses,
first king of the Twenty-seventh Dynasty (Persian), sent an Embassy
into Ethiopia, and on this being received by the natives with
jeers, collected a large army and sent it south against them.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 527</span>He
detached 50,000 men from the army when it arrived at Thebes against
Siwa, or more probably Kharga, Oasis, but these were all
overwhelmed by a sandstorm and were never heard of again. The
remainder, ill-supplied with food or transport, marched into a
desert on the way south, ate their transport animals, and finally
began on each other; the greater part undoubtedly perished of
hunger and thirst. It is impossible to trace where the disaster
happened (Arbain road?), but it appears not to have been very far
south, perhaps no further than the latitude of Aswan. The latest
critic (Heinrich SchÃ¤fer) argues from Nastasenenâs inscription that
Cambyses sent, in concert with the desert expedition, another one
by river. This latter expedition seems to have reached the 3rd
Cataract, where it was met and defeated by Nastasenen; this is,
however, not yet universally accepted. Cambyses is reported to have
himself reached the âIslandâ of Meroe, to have built a town there,
and to have named it after his sister Meroe, who died there; but
this is certainly a fable.</p>

<p>Between <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 525 and 260 came 11 more
kings, but their chronology is more than doubtful, and little is
known of them beyond their names, which are as follows:â</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Heru Nekht.</li>

<li>Sekheper en Ra, Senka Amen Seken.</li>

<li>Khuka Ra, Athlenersa (and four other names).</li>

<li>Kheper ka Ra Amen Netek.</li>

<li>Amen-tani-Ralbath.</li>

<li>Amen Arit, Kenthahebit.</li>

<li>Ankh Ra Ra, Arkenkhernlu.</li>

<li>Kenrethreknen.</li>

<li>Khenem ab Ra, Amenarkneb.</li>

<li>Kalka, Kaltela.</li>

<li>Ankh nefer ah Ra, Amen Mer Aser.</li>
</ul>

<p>These names are here given for reference in case of future
discoveries.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
300.</span>About 300 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> (?), or perhaps
earlier, the frontier of Egypt was then fixed at a point about 80
miles south of Aswan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
260.</span>Ark Amen, better known as Ergamenes, who was brought up
at the court of Ptolemy II, was a man of some character, for
besides building a temple at Dakka he set a new fashion in
Priest-Kings by refusing to commit suicide at the request of the
priests and by executing those who demanded it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
210.</span>In the days of Ptolemy V, Nubia caused trouble to Egypt,
and the Egyptian king added the country between Aswan and Napata
(?) to his possessions, dividing it into 13 districts.</p>

<p>In later Ptolemaic times the kings of Ethiopia evidently became
more negroid, and owned barbaric names; and as time went on, the
Kingdom of Meroe seems to have been governed by a series of queens
or queen-mothers, bearing the title of Candace. Little is known of
this period.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
30.</span>When Egypt became a Roman province, an embassy from
Ethiopia arrived at PhilÃ¦, and the king of the country near
Khartoum was taken under Roman protection.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
22.</span>Eight years after, a Queen Candace attacked Aswan and
routed the Roman garrison there. She was, however, heavily defeated
by the Prefect Petronius, who pursued her as far as Napata (?) and
destroyed that town, leaving Roman garrisons there and near to
Dongola.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
200.</span>In the time of Strabo, who visited Egypt during the
government of Ãlius Gallus, Petroniusâs successor, Aswan was again
the frontier, the Romans having, as he observes, âconfined the
province of Egypt within its former limits.â PhilÃ¦ then belonged
âin common to the Egyptians and Ethiopians.â This did not, however,
prevent the CÃ¦sars from considering Lower Ethiopia as belonging to
them or from adding to the temples already erected there.</p>

<p>The descendants of the priest-kings of Ethiopia seem to have
died out about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 200.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Strabo says the
Ethiopians above Aswan consisted of the TroglodytÃ¦, Blemmyes, NubÃ¦,
and Megabari. The Megabari and Blemmyes inhabited the Eastern
Desert north of Meroe, towards the frontiers of Egypt, and were
under the dominion of the Ethiopians.<a id=
"FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a> The Ichthyophagi<a id=
"FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class=
"fnanchor">[150]</a> lived on the shore of the Red Sea; the
TroglodytÃ¦, from BerenikÃª southwards, between it and the Nile; and
the NubÃ¦, an âAfricanâ nation, were on the left bank, and
independent of Ethiopia, which country, he states, did not extend
north of Halfa.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
296.</span>From Procopius we learn that in <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 296, in the reign of Diocletian, these NubÃ¦, or
NobatÃ¦, were brought from the Oasis of El Kharga, and given the
country above Aswan, on condition of their protecting Egypt against
the incursion of the Blemmyes. This treaty was annually ratified by
a religious sacrifice, according to the rites of the ancient
Egyptian religion, on the Island of PhilÃ¦, in which the Roman
garrison took part. There are still the remains of the wall which
Diocletian built across the valley near here; and, according to
some authorities, not venturing to trust entirely to the Nubians to
defend the Egyptian frontier, he agreed to pay a yearly tribute
both to the Nubians and the Blemmyes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
330.</span>A few years afterwards two young Christians of Tyre,
Edesius and Frumentius, were, on their return journey by sea from
India (?), kidnapped on the coast of Abyssinia. According to their
story they became advisers to the widow of the king who had
captured them, and used all their influence to promote Christianity
in the land. They succeeded so well that Frumentius, on his return
to Alexandria, was consecrated by Bishop Athanasius and returned to
Abyssinia, where he spent the rest of his life in proselytizing,
with excellent results.</p>

<p>Little or nothing is known of the history of internal or Upper
Nubia during these centuries, but the Blemmyes continued to give
trouble to the Roman rulers of Egypt. They gradually succeeded in
occupying the five towns of the Commilitium Romanum, making Talmis
or Kalabsha their capital, and even penetrated into the ThebaÃ¯d,
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
451.</span>where in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 451 Maximinus,
the general of Marcian, was forced to make a treaty with them for
100 years. But it was soon broken by the barbarians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
400-500.</span>In the fifth century the Nubians, whose religion at
that time was chiefly limited to star-worship, were gradually
converted by monks and others of the Alexandrian Church. The first
important convert was one Bahriya (?), nephew of the king, and he
built many churches and monasteries.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
545.</span>During the sixth century the entire nation adopted
Christianity. In <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 545 their King Silko
defeated the Blemmyes and took the already well-known town of (old)
Dongola for his capital.</p>

<p>The Egypto-Roman-Christian remains at Nagaa<a id=
"FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class=
"fnanchor">[151]</a>, and those of the kingdom of Alwa, or Soba,
then under the King of Nubia, may belong to this or even to an
earlier period, for there are legends of Christianity having
penetrated to the Blue Nile in the third century, and St. Mark is
reported to have preached in the Sudan, or at all events, in
âEthiopia,â in the first century, <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
560.</span>In the days of Justinian there seems to be no doubt that
Christianity was the established religion of the whole of Ethiopia
and Nubia.</p>

<hr class="decor width3 spaced2">

<p class="sch">FROM THE ARAB INVASION TO THE TIME OF MOHAMMED
ALI.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 640.
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 643.</span>After the Arab invasion
and conquest of Egypt, Abdalla ibn Said was sent by âAmr, at the
command of Omar, with 20,000 men (?) into Nubia. The natives,
however, offered a most stubborn defence and fought to the death.
Their bowmen showed particular skill, and although the Moslems were
eventually victorious, they judged it expedient to retreat across
the frontier. The Nubians now exhausted themselves in objectless
raids northwards, and irritated the Arabs to such a pitch,
<span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
653.</span>that ten years afterwards, the same general marched
again into the country with the resolute purpose of subduing
it.</p>

<p>The result was that Abdalla penetrated as far as (old) Dongola,
bombarded the great church there and laid it in ruins. King
Kalidurat thereupon concluded a friendly treaty with him, the chief
clauses of which were that he should supply 400 slaves a year, and
allow the Mohammedans to build a mosque at Dongola.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
700.</span>As regards the rest of the Sudan, it is said that
between the first and second century after the Mohammedan Era the
Arabs of the tribe of Beni Ommia, being hard pressed by the Beni
Abbas tribe, began to emigrate from Arabia in small numbers to the
opposite shores of the Red Sea, and to settle in the districts
about Sennar, on the Blue Nile. Whether the Beni Ommia led the van
of the great Arab invasion it is impossible to say, nor is it known
whether all the tribes chose the Red Sea road. Some authorities
appear to think that several came into the Sudan from Egypt and
Marocco.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the fact remains that the Beni Ommia settled
gradually in the districts round Sennar, the inhabitants of which
were negroes belonging to the tribes of Fung, Hameg, etc.</p>

<p>The Beni Ommia, becoming gradually stronger, by degrees
succeeded in becoming the masters of the whole of the Sennar
districts, and converted the negroes to Islamism.</p>

<p>During the next two centuries the ever-increasing demands of the
Arabs for slaves began to press on the country, and the Christian
kingdoms, which had meanwhile been increasing in population,
refused to pay tribute in this commodity.</p>

<p>Many Arabs began now to settle in the Sudan, and purchased lands
from the inhabitants. In order to put a stop to this, Zacharias,
King of Nubia, despatched his son, George, through Egypt to
Baghdad, to see how the land lay. <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 831.</span>He was
graciously received by the Khalif Mutassim, who loaded him with
presents, and gave him a house in Cairo. Eventually he returned
after most successful negotiations, and all idea of open rebellion
was dropped by the Nubians.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 years later Nubia was the scene of a filibustering
expedition on a large scale. <span class="sidenote"><span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 878.</span>One Abu Abdelrahman âel Omari,â
hearing of the ancient gold mines in the Eastern Desert, equipped a
party to work them. He found a great deal of gold, but being
obstructed by the local Arabs, he gradually pushed his way to
Shankir, south of Dongola, and with his increased following
attacked the Nubians under King George and beat them. His
subsequent adventures read like a romance, <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 880.</span>but he was
eventually driven out and murdered.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
950.</span>In the following century the Christian kingdoms
gradually became strong enough to resist the Arabs, and on
occasions they even invaded Upper Egypt. <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 956.</span>In <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 956 the Nubians seized Aswan, but were cut off by
a flanking movement instituted from the Red Sea, by the Moslem
General Kafur, and lost Deir Ibrahim, a stronghold 136 miles south
of Aswan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
967.</span>Eleven years later, however, they again invaded Egypt
and recovered their country as far as Akhmim.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
969.</span>Two years afterwards Johar, a Greek renegade general of
the Khalif Moiz, seeing the necessity of guarding his southern
frontier, sent an embassy to the then King of Nubia (another
George), inviting him to embrace Islam and pay his tribute as of
old. The chief ambassador was one Ahmed ibn Solaim, and the account
he writes of the Sudan in those days is exceedingly
interesting.</p>

<p>He describes the province which extended from 6 miles south of
Aswan to Halfa as well-watered, carefully cultivated and abounding
in vineyards. Beyond this no Moslems were allowed inside Nubia on
pain of death. Between the 2nd and 3rd Cataract was a terrible
desert, from which, however, precious jewel-polishing stones were
obtained (?). Beyond this lay the kingdom of Makorra, with capital
at Dongola, and south of this was the Kingdom of Alwa, which was
stronger and more fertile, but did not produce so many vines and
palms as Makorra. Both kingdoms he describes as being amazingly
fertile in herds and crops, far more so than Egypt (!).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>He arrived at
Suia (Soba), capital of Alwa, which was situated at the confluence
of the Blue and White Niles, and, besides noting the excellence of
their camels, horses, meat and beer, states that the town was
âadorned with magnificent buildings, great houses, churches
enriched with gold, and gardens. The King also wears a crown of
gold, for this metal is very abundant in his dominions.â Amongst
other things he remarks that the Christians belonged to the
Jacobite Church of Egypt, and that their books, originally written
in Greek, had been translated into their own language. He also
refers to a road leading from Shankir to Suakin.</p>

</div>

<p>Ibn Solaimâs mission met with every courtesy but no success, and
his report convinced Johar that he would act wisely in leaving
Nubia severely alone.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1092.</span>In <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1092 the Kings of
Ethiopia and Nubia were so powerful that the Moslems of Egypt
feared to persecute the Christians; <span class=
"sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1172.</span>but 80 years
later the Nubians were conquered by the brother of Saladin and
forcibly converted to Mohammedanism.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1227.</span>Fifty years afterwards the Nubians were again defeated
and gave up to Egypt the Northern part of their Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1271.</span>In <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1271 King David of
Nubia attacked Aswan, but was repulsed by the Khalif Bibars. The
Mohammedans overran Nubia as far as Dongola, seized the northern
province and imposed onerous conditions, one of which was the
revival of the slave tribute.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1287.</span>Sixteen years later the Khalif Kalaun sent another
expedition to Dongola, beat King Shemamun, left a garrison and
retired. The Nubians promptly expelled the garrison, and the
expedition was repeated, only to end in the same result.
Thenceforward Shemamun was left in peace.</p>

<p>From this time onwards the Sudan apparently became the hunting
ground of rival Arab slave-dealing tribes. The Christian kingdoms
at last took to fighting among themselves, and their downfall
became a mere question of time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1317.</span>Thirty years later the great mosque was built at (old)
Dongola, and kept up by the Christian inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1325.</span>In <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1325 the Moslems
persecuted the Christians in Egypt to such an extent that the King
of Abyssinia threatened to divert the Blue Nile unless they
ceased.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1375.</span>Fifty years later we find civil wars and slave trade
rife in the Sudan, whilst in the region of Aswan the Kenz, royal
descendants of Ethiopia, pursued the trade of brigands, much to the
detriment of all communications.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1493.</span>The rise of the kingdom of Sennar now commenced. By
degrees the distinction between Arab and negro on the Blue Nile had
diminished, whilst in 1493 the name of Beni Ommia is no longer
heard of, and the old tribal names of Fung, Hameg, and others
reappear.</p>

<p>In that year Amara Dunkas, the Sheikh of a sub-section of the
Fung, either through the fortune of war or his superior capacity,
succeeded in getting himself declared king of all the Fung tribes.
He then allied himself with Abdulla Gemda el Kerinani, the powerful
chief of the Keri district (east of the Blue Nile), and conquered
all the country on both sides of the river between Fazogli and
Khartoum.</p>

<p>These districts were inhabited by negroes belonging to the Nuba
tribes, some of whom after the conquest remained<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> in the country, while others
emigrated into the mountains of Fazogli and Kordofan. Those who
remained embraced Islamism, intermarried with their conquerors,
and, losing their language and nationality, were soon lost in the
tribes known collectively under the name of Fung.</p>

<p>Of these tribes some settled in towns, while others retained
their nomad habits, such as the (1) Khamir, (2) Rebia, (3) Kakhtan,
(4) Kenana, (5) Kawahla, (6) Geheina, (7) Beni Shaker, (8) Beni
Ziban, (9) Beni Abbas. From this last have descended the Kababish,
Ferara, Beni Selim, and Ahamda. The latter two tribes are Baggara,
or owners of cattle and horses. (<em>Vide</em> <a href=
"#Page_179">p. 179</a> and <a href="#appf">Appendix F.</a>)</p>

<p>Some of these tribes are now to be found along the banks of the
White and Blue Niles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1523.</span>In 1523 Amara Dunkas was succeeded by his son Abdul
Kader.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1539.</span>In 1539 Abdul Kader was succeeded by his son Nule.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1545.</span>In 1545 Nule was succeeded by his son Amara.</p>

<p>Amara was surnamed Abu Sakakin; during his reign Sheikh Abdalla
GemÃ¡a died, leaving the Province of Keri to his son.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1553.</span>In 1553 Amara died. Between that date and 1596 four
kings, all of the family of Dunkas, succeeded each other.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1596.</span>In 1596, in the reign of Adlan, Sheikh Agib, a
descendant of GemÃ¡a and Governor of Keri, rebelled. Adlan defeated
him near Alati. His children fled to Dongola, whither Adlan sent
Sheikh Idris to offer them a free pardon and invite them to Sennar.
They came, and Adlan invested the eldest with the Government of
Keri.</p>

<p>This emissary of Adlanâs, Sheikh Idris, was celebrated for his
ability. He is also said to have lived to the great age of 147.
During this reign many learned men came from Cairo and Baghdad.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1603.</span>In 1603 Adlan was succeeded by his son Baadi.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1606.</span>In 1606 Baadi was succeeded by his son Rubat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1635.</span>In 1635 Rubat was succeeded by his son Baadi Abu Dign
(Father of the Beard).</p>

<p>This King attacked the Shilluk negroes and took a large number
of slaves. The Shilluk inhabited the country on both sides of the
White Nile south of Kawa. Thence he invaded the mountains of Tagale
and destroyed Kordofan, where he again took a large number of
slaves. On his return to Sennar he built a number of villages in
that district for his prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoners named these villages after those they had left,
hence the number of villages now near Sennar with names similar to
those in the Jebel Nuba, Tagale, and other districts about
Kordofan.</p>

<p>In time these slaves supplied the Kings of Fung with recruits
for their armies.</p>

<p>Besides his warlike enterprise, Baadi built the mosque now at
Sennar, and furnished it with copper window bars.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1671.</span>In 1671 he died, and was succeeded by his son Ansu.
During this reign there was a great famine and an outbreak of
small-pox.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1683.</span>In 1683 Ansu was succeeded by his son Baadi el Ahmar.
In this reign a number of the Fung tribes and the people of Keri
under their prince, rebelled, but they were defeated with great
slaughter, and the Prince of Keri was killed. Sheikh Hamed Walad el
Terabi, a celebrated Sheikh, lived during this reign. His tomb is
now at Sennar.</p>

<p>In 1699 Dr. Poncet, a French physician, on his way to Abyssinia
visited Sennar, and found it a powerful kingdom in a flourishing
condition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1710.</span>In 1710 Baadi was succeeded by his son Ansu II. This
monarch caused such great dissatisfaction by his extravagance and
debauchery that the Southern Fungs revolted, deposed the King, and
placed a noble called Nur on the throne. This happened in 1714.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1719.</span>In 1719 Nur was succeeded by his son Gaadi Abu Shilluk.
In this reign the Abyssinian King Kedem Yasu invaded Sennar with a
large army. He was, however, defeated with great slaughter by
Sheikh Amin, near the village of Tekiya on the Dinder River. It is
said that the reason for this invasion was that some presents sent
by the King of France to Abyssinia had been seized by King
Baadi.</p>

<p>After this great victory the renown of Sennar spread in all
directions, and eventually reached Constantinople. Crowds of
learned and celebrated men flocked into the country from Arabia,
Egypt, and India. Notwithstanding this, in 1758 Baadi, owing to his
bad administration was deposed and exiled. He was succeeded by his
son Nasser.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1758.</span>1758.âUnder his rule the Hameg tribe became very
powerful, and the Fung lost a great deal of their influence and
prestige. In 1765 Nasser was killed by a rebellious vassal, and was
succeeded by his son Ismail.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1774.</span>In 1774 Ismail was deposed, exiled to Suakin, and
succeeded by his son Adlan. During this reign many intertribal wars
went on both in Sennar and Kordofan,<a id=
"FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class=
"fnanchor">[152]</a> and the power and influence of the Hameg grew
so great that they eventually became the masters of the King.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1786.</span>In 1786 Adlan was deposed by the Hameg, and the kingdom
of the Fung totally disappeared. Anarchy prevailed throughout the
country, and the kings succeeded each other in such rapid
succession that in the year 1788 four kings successively reigned.
During the succeeding 33 years of anarchy the Hameg continued
supreme, and under Sheikh Nasser they devastated the northern and
eastern part of the Sudan with fire and sword.</p>

<p class="sch">FROM MOHAMMED ALIâS CONQUEST TO THE END OF 1882.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1819. Invasion by Mohammed Ali.</span>In
1819 Mohammed Ali, hearing of the anarchy prevailing in the Sudan,
and wishing to introduce the benefits of a regular government of
civilisation, and at the same time to occupy his troops, ordered
his son Ismail, with a numerous army of regulars and irregulars,
with many learned men and artisans, to invade the country.</p>

<p>Ismail reached Khartoum without meeting with any resistance, and
thence marched on to Sennar. Here he found that of the two rivals
to the throne of Baadi, Adlan had been murdered by Regab, and the
latter had fled, leaving the kingdom to the Fung claimant, Baadi.
The latter, however, had resigned his claims to Ismail.</p>

<p>At Sennar Ismail was joined by his brother, Ibrahim Pasha, and
they together advanced to Fazogli. Shortly after, Ibrahim returned
to Egypt, and the report spread that Ibrahim had been killed in the
Fazogli Mountains. The Arab nomads immediately rose, but Ismail
returned, defeated the rebels, and appointed new Sheikhs. He then
went on to Shendi, on the Nile. The Mek (ruler) Nimr (tiger) of
that place, wishing to be revenged of all the cruelties and
barbarities Ismail had been guilty of, invited him and his
followers to a great banquet at Shendi. <span class=
"sidenote">Ismail burnt at Shendi. 1822.</span>During the banquet
and while the guests were all more or less intoxicated, forage was
piled round the tent and set on fire, and Ismail and all his
followers perished (1822).</p>

<p>When the news of this catastrophe reached Kordofan, Ahmed Bey,
the Defterdar, who had wrested that province from the Darfur
Sultan, put himself at the head of a large army and marched on
Shendi. When he reached Metemma, opposite Shendi, the inhabitants
sent to ask for pardon. This was granted. One of the people,
however, happening to throw a lance at the Defterdar, the pardon
was at once rescinded, and a general massacre took place. The Mek
el Nimr, however, escaped, and fled towards Abyssinia.</p>

<p>After this the Defterdar marched to Tuti Island, opposite
Khartoum, where he again defeated the rebels with great slaughter.
He then marched to Wad Medani, near Mesellemia, and then returned
to Kordofan.</p>

<p>It is said that when Kordofan was conquered it was found that
the Governor of the Province had the title of Magdum, which is a
title only given to Palace eunuchs. It would appear that it was the
custom of the Darfur Sultans to send eunuchs to govern provinces
and districts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1822.</span>In 1822 Osman Bey was named
Governor of the Sudan, and the Defterdar, Ahmed Bey, returned to
Egypt. This was a year of rebellions and famines.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1826.</span>In 1826 Maho Bey was
appointed Governor. Immediately afterwards Khurshid Pasha became
Governor. He was renowned for his rectitude and honesty. He led
several expeditions up the White Nile against the Dinka negro
tribe, opposite Kodok, and also into the mountains of Tagale.
<span class="sidenote">1834.</span>In 1834 he went to Egypt for a
few months. Towards the end of that year he marched to the
Abyssinian frontier to repel the attack of the Abyssinians who were
coming to the assistance of the Sennar rebels. The Abyssinians were
defeated, and Adlan, their leader, was taken and impaled. During
this year cholera and other diseases ravaged the country. In 1836
the Abyssinians, after attacking the Gallabat provinces, retreated
into their mountains.</p>

<p>Khurshid Pasha was the first Governor who taught the people of
Khartoum to build with bricks, and to give up their huts made of
skins and reeds. <span class="sidenote">1839.</span>In 1839 he was
recalled to Egypt, and was succeeded by Ahmed Pasha Abu Udn (Father
of Large Ears).<a id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153"
class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The annexation of the Sudan provinces thus took place more than
three-quarters of a century ago. Mohammed Ali having dispersed the
Mamelukes, and made himself master of Nubia, turned his attention
towards the districts bordering the White and the Blue branches of
the Nile. Gold was doubtless his main object, for he had heard
rumours of mines of vast wealth; but we must also give him credit
for an honest intention to introduce commerce and civilisation into
the midst of the Negro tribes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Expedition by Mohammed Ali, 1838.</span>In the autumn of
1838 Mohammed Ali himself, at the age of 69, started to visit
Fazogli, and in 1840 and following years three large expeditions
were organised. Although gold was not found in any important
quantities, the provinces were reduced under Egyptian sway, the
navigation of the White Nile was declared free, military stations
were established on both rivers, and many slaves were brought back
to swell the ranks of Mohammedâs army. Whatever may have been his
dreams of civilisation, the result of Mohammedâs expedition and
consequent government was to establish at Khartoum, not only the
capital of the Sudan provinces, but also a central mart for a huge
slave trade.</p>

<p>The provinces thus annexed were Kordofan, Sennar, and Taka
(Kassala).</p>

kept up his authority in the Sudan provinces by means of a large
force, which was necessary for the purpose of collecting taxes from
a discontented population. In 1853 the most southern Egyptian
settlement was about 120 miles south of Khartoum, but in that year
the first trading voyage to the Upper Nile was started by Mr.
Petherick, the English Consul for the Sudan. He was soon followed
by other traders, who established posts far up country, and
organised armed bands under the command of Arabs. It was soon found
that slave hunting paid even better than ivory, and raids were made
on the surrounding tribes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1854-1868.</span>Said Pasha, the
successor of Abbas, found the country in a deplorable condition;
exhorbitant taxes, a depressed agriculture, and a disordered
administration openly encouraging an open slave trade.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Said Pasha reorganises Government at
Khartoum, 1857.</span>With the resolution of organising a better
state of things, Said, in the year 1857, made a rapid tour through
the provinces in question. At Berber he proclaimed the abolition of
slavery, and at Khartoum he organised a new government for the five
provinces then comprised in the Sudan, <em>i.e.</em>, Kordofan,
Sennar, Taka, Berber and Dongola. He ordered that the excessive
taxes on the lands and waterwheels of the people should be
discontinued, and postal services on fast camels organised across
the desert. About the year 1860 the European traders sold their
stations to their Arab agents who paid rental to the Egyptian
Government, and the misery and ruin were increased tenfold.</p>

<p>To Said Pasha is due the first idea for making a railway to
unite the Sudan with Lower Egypt; Mougel Bey was ordered to report
on the subject, but the probable expense caused the project to be
abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Source of the Nile discovered.</span>The
sources of the Nile had long been the object of much speculation,
but comparatively little had been done to solve the question.
Towards the latter end of the eighteenth century, Bruce had tracked
the Blue Nile to its origin in the Abyssinian mountains, but the
White Nile remained unexplored till Speke and Grant, carrying out
in 1860-62 an expedition organised by the English Government,
proved that the Victoria Nyanza, discovered by Speke<a id=
"FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a> in July, <span class=
"sidenote">1858.</span>1858, was the source of the Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sir S. Bakerâs expedition in
1861.</span>In 1861 Sir Samuel Baker started on an expedition from
Cairo <em>viÃ¢</em> Khartoum, with hopes of meeting the travellers
in question, and of making independent investigations on his own
account. He was successful in both ways, and his explorations
resulted in the discovery, in 1864, of Albert Nyanza Lake.
<span class="sidenote">State of the Sudan in 1864.</span>His
description of the Sudan at this period under the governorship of a
certain Musa Pasha gives a melancholy picture of the results of
Egyptian rule. He describes the provinces as utterly ruined and
only governed by military force, the revenue unequal to the
expenditure, and the country paralysed by excessive taxation; shut
in by deserts, all communication with the outer world was most
difficult; and the existing conditions rendered these countries so
worthless to the State, that their annexation could only be
accounted for by the fruits of the slave trade.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ismail Pasha, 1863.</span>On Ismail Pasha
coming to the throne in 1863, orders for the suppression of the
slave trade were issued, and on Bakerâs return journey in 1865, he
found an Egyptian camp of 1,000 men established at Kodok in the
Shilluk country for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Scheme for railway again brought forward,
1865-66.</span>In 1865-6 the Khedive again brought forward the
scheme for a Sudan Railway, and a study of the country from Aswan
to Khartoum was made by Mr. Walker and Mr. Bray, but nothing came
of it. About the same time Mr. Hawkshaw recommended the
canalisation of the 1st Cataract, but this was strongly opposed by
Mr. Fowler, who proposed as an alternative to construct a ship
incline over land, using the mechanical force supplied by the
descending water.</p>

<p>Ismail Pasha not only determined to extend his territories, but
seemed in earnest to put down the slave trade.</p>

<p>The traders were chiefly Arab subjects of the Khedive, and the
traffic was being carried out under the cloak of legitimate
commerce. Khartoum was the headquarters for the trading companies,
who leased from the Governor-General of the Sudan certain districts
nominally for carrying on the ivory trade, for which they bought
the monopoly. In these transactions the Government did not hesitate
to lease territories over which they had not a vestige of right; in
fact, any portion of Central Africa south of Khartoum was
considered open to them for selling the monopoly. The result was
that certain traders established themselves in, and claimed a sort
of proprietary right to large districts, especially in that part
which lies to the South of Darfur and Kordofan, and borders the
course of the White Nile, now known as the Bahr El Ghazal. Traffic
in slaves was the real business carried on, and for this purpose
the traders organised armies of brigands, and formed chains of
stations, of about 300 men each, throughout their districts.
Raids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> were made on
native tribes, who were obliged to submit, fly the country, or ally
themselves to the slave hunters, to be used against other tribes;
and anarchy prevailed throughout the country.</p>

<p>In order to carry out the reforms it was necessary to annex the
Nile Basin, to establish a sound government and commerce, and to
open the Equatorial Lakes to steam navigation. The Khedive
accordingly issued a firman to Sir S. Baker on 1st April,
<span class="sidenote">1869.</span>1869, whereby he gave him
absolute and supreme power over all the country south of
Gondokoro.</p>

<p>Baker left Suez for Suakin in December, 1869, and proceeded to
Khartoum, where the expedition was fitted out.</p>

<p>He experienced much opposition from officials, who were all more
or less implicated in the slave trade. He also made the discovery
that the very provinces he was about to annex were already leased
by the Governor-General of the Sudan to a notorious slave-trader,
named Ahmed Sheikh Aga, whose son in-law and partner, Abu Saud, was
a still more notorious character.</p>

<p>Another expedition was being fitted out, at the same time, to
the Bahr el Ghazal, for the purpose of establishing a settlement at
some copper mines on the frontier of Darfur.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Annexation of Gondokoro, May 26th,
1871.</span>In February 1870 Baker left Khartoum, and after several
abortive attempts, with great difficulty succeeded in dragging his
boats over the sudd in the Bahr El Zeraf and arrived at Gondokoro,
and formally annexed this station, as âIsmailia,â on May 26th,
1871. In January, 1872, he left Gondokoro for the south, and on the
14th May of the same year, at Masindi, <span class=
"sidenote">Unyoro annexed, 14th May, 1872.</span>proclaimed Unyoro
an Egyptian province. He organised military posts such at Masindi,
Foweira, Fatiko, etc., and entered into friendly relations with
Mâtesa, the King of Uganda, thus establishing the Khediveâs rule to
within 2Â° of the Equator. He dealt the slave trade a heavy blow by
putting a stop to it in the annexed territory, as well as on the
Nile, so that all exit for the traffic in the direction of Khartoum
would have been closed if the officials could have been
trusted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Baker returns to Cairo, August, 1873.</span>In August,
1873, Baker returned to Cairo, and the Khedive put the Government
of the Sudan on a fresh footing, by dividing it into provinces
under responsible governors, more or less independent of the
Governor of Khartoum. Thus Yusef Effendi was made Governor of
Kodok, Ismail Yagub Pasha of Khartoum, and Hussein Khalifa of
Berber.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1871. Railway scheme again taken
up.</span>In 1871 the railway scheme was again taken up; Mr. Fowler
was employed by the Khedive to make careful surveys, and the result
was an elaborately prepared project for making a line from Wadi
Halfa, <em>viÃ¢</em> Shendi, to Khartoum, with a plan for the
passage of the 1st Cataract. Such a line would have been of vast
importance in opening up the trade of Central Africa.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1874. Colonel Gordon appointed Governor
of Equatorial Provinces.</span>At the close of Sir Samuel Bakerâs
expedition, the Khedive, still anxious to consolidate his Empire,
appointed Colonel Gordon, R.E., to carry on the work. Gordon
arrived in Cairo early in 1874, and left for the scenes of his
future operations on 21st February. His appointed task was to
continue the reconnaissance of the Upper Nile, to establish a
Government, and to destroy the slave trade. Accompanying him were
Lieut.-Colonel Long, an American officer in the service of the
Khedive, Lieut. Hassan Wassif, and a number of European civil
employÃ©s. It was arranged that the territory over which the
Governor-General of the Sudan now ruled was to be limited to the
south by Kodok; Gordon to be Governor-General of the Equatorial
provinces of the Nile, and the respective headquarters to be at
Khartoum and Gondokoro.</p>

<p>Gordon left Khartoum in March, 1874, and reached Gondokoro the
15th of the following month, where he was cordially received by the
Commandant, Rauf Bey. He found that the provinces in question were
merely nominally under Egyptian control, there being but two
garrisons, one at Gondokoro consisting of 450 men, 150 of whom were
Egyptian soldiers, and a second at Fatiko of 200 Sudan soldiers.
His first steps were to occupy Bor, an important position north of
Gondokoro, and to send Colonel Long on an expedition to Mâtesa,
King of Uganda. <span class="sidenote">Slave stations broken up,
1874.</span>He then in June, 1874, proceeded to break up three
large slave-trading stations on the Bahr el Zeraf, and established
a strong post at the Sobat junction, so situated as to be able to
arrest all illegal traffic on the river. The liberated slaves he,
in accordance with their own option, planted at Sobat, and
encouraged them to turn their attention to agriculture, it being
one of his ideas that most of the wars between the tribes were
caused by the great deficiency of food.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1874, Rauf Bey returned to Cairo, and was
given the command of the Harrar country. Gordon sent Gessi about
the same time to make an inspection along the Bahr el Ghazal.</p>

<p>Abu Saud, notorious in Bakerâs time, had accompanied Gordon from
Cairo. The latter, though aware of his character, knew him to be a
man of great influence among the slave-dealing communities, and
determined to turn him to account. On first taking over the
government at Gondokoro, he made Abu Saud his lieutenant, and
employed many of the other slave dealers under him. This, however,
was of short duration; Abu Saud soon got beyond himself, and,
showing his true character, was speedily dismissed by Gordon;
while, towards the end of the year, a clean sweep was made of all
the other slave-dealing Dongolese, whose intrigues had seriously
hampered Longâs expedition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">September, 1874. Submission of chiefs
round Gondokoro.</span>On 11th September, 1874, 25 chiefs of the
tribes round Gondokoro came in to pay homage to Gordon, a
remarkable proof of the success of his rule, as up to this they had
been at open enmity with the garrisons.</p>

<p>In October Yusef Bey, Governor of Kodok, intercepted a convoy of
1,600 slaves and 190 head of cattle from the stations of Ratatz and
Kuchuk Ali on the Bahr El Zeraf.</p>

<p>About this time Gordon was making preparations for his
expedition to the lakes. The sections of the steamers, which had
been left at Gondokoro by Baker, were sent forward by carriers, to
be put together at the Falls of Dufile, beyond which point there is
a free passage to the lake Albert Nyanza.</p>

<p>It was decided to establish fortified posts at the following
stations:âLabore, Dufile, Fatiko, and Foweira; this step was
rendered necessary by the hostile attitude shown towards Colonel
Longâs expedition by the King of Unyoro backed up by
slave-traders.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1874. Representative sent to
Mâtesa.</span>In consequence of the report of Colonel Long, who
returned in October, Gordon arranged to send a trustworthy
representative<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a> to Mâtesa, King of Uganda, who had shown
himself to be friendly.</p>

<p>On the 21st November Gondokoro was abandoned as the headquarters
in favour of Lado, a more healthy spot a few miles down the river,
while another post was established at Rejaf, a short distance up
the river.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1874 Gordon reported the organisation
of governmental districts along the whole line of his provinces,
the chief stations being the following:â</p>

<p class="space-above1">1. Sobat, at the junction of the Sobat
River with the Nile; garrison, 50 Sudan regulars.</p>

<p>2. Nasser, on the Sobat; garrison, 100 Dongolese irregulars.</p>

<p>3. Ghabatshambe (Shambe), 30 Sudan regulars, 150 Dongolese
irregulars.</p>

<p>4. Makaraka, 20 Sudan regulars, 150 Dongolese irregulars.</p>

<p>10. Fatiko, 250 Sudan regulars, 100 Egyptian regulars.</p>

<p>11. Foweira, 100 Sudan regulars, 100 Egyptian regulars.</p>

<p class="pad2 space-above1">The results of the nine monthsâ work
are summed up by the Egyptian General Staff<a id=
"FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class=

<p>1st. The White Nile had been mapped with very considerable
accuracy from Khartoum to Rejaf by Lieutenants C. M. Watson and
Chippendall, R.E.</p>

<p>2nd. The slave trade on the White Nile had received a deadly
blow.</p>

<p>3rd. Confidence and peace had been restored among the tribes
round Gondokoro, who now freely brought in for sale their beef,
corn, and ivory.</p>

<p>4th. The work of opening a water communication between Gondokoro
and the lakes had been seriously commenced.</p>

<p>5th. Communications had been established with Mâtesa, and the
connection of Lake Victoria with Lake Albert, by the way of the
Victoria Nile, demonstrated.</p>

<p>6th. Government districts had been formed and secure posts with
intercommunication established.</p>

<p>7th. New expeditions were organised and ready to commence.</p>

<h3>CONQUEST OF DARFUR, 1874.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Conquest of Darfur, 1874.</span>During
the year 1874 an important addition was made to the Egyptian
possessions in the shape of the Province of Darfur.</p>

<p>Gordon writes:ââDar For and Dar Fertit mean <em>the land of the
Fors</em> and <em>the land of the Fertits</em>. The Fors and the
Fertits were the original negro inhabitants; then came in the
Beduin tribes, who partially conquered the country and made the
Fors Mussulmans, giving them a Sultan. The Fors and the Beduin
tribes, the one stationary and the other nomadic, live in peace,
for their habits are different.â</p>

<p>The country of Darfur had never been subjugated, but had been
governed by its own Sultans in unbroken succession for more than
400 years.<a id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a> The inhabitants were not of the true negro
type, and the numerous wandering Arab tribes paid tribute to the
Sultan and formed the bulk of his fighting men. Darfur enjoyed the
celebrity not only as a centre of commerce, but also as a large
slave depÃ´t, a fact which appears from the following correspondence
which passed between Bonaparte and Sultan Abd-el-Rahman, surnamed
âthe Just.â During the French expedition to Egypt, âthe Justâ wrote
to Bonaparte âIn the name of God the compassionate, the merciful,â
saying he was glad to hear that he had conquered the Mamelukes. The
reply was as follows:ââAu Sultan du Darfour, 12 Messidor, an VII,
au nom de Dieu, clÃ©ment et misÃ©ricordieux, il nây a dâautre Dieu
que Dieu! au Sultan du Dar-fur Abd-el-RahmÃ¢n.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bellalâs expedition to Bahr El Ghazal
destroyed by Zubeir, 1869.</span>Dating from the days of Mohammed
Aliâs expeditions, Darfur was in constant dread of Egyptian
aggression, and the country was practically closed to all
Europeans, who were regarded as spies. For many generations Darfur
had sent annually a caravan containing ivory, feathers, gum,
slaves, etc., to Egypt, bringing back in exchange cloth, beads,
firearms, etc. In 1874, the slave trade having been stopped in
Egyptian territory, the Governor of the Sudan seized all the slaves
belonging to the caravan of that year; this was one of the causes
which led to a rupture with the Sultan of Darfur.</p>

<p>In 1869 the power of the slave dealers in the Bahr El Ghazal had
become so great that they refused to pay their rentals to the
Egyptian Government. Conspicuous among them was a certain Zubeir
Rahama, who, according to Dr. Schweinfurth, lived in princely style
and was regarded as a kind of king.</p>

<p>With the object of re-establishing his authority in the Bahr El
Ghazal provinces, and also of conquering Darfur, the Khedive sent a
small force under the command of Bellal. This force was destroyed
by Zubeir, who became the chief power in the country. The Sultan of
Darfur, in the meantime, to meet Bellalâs threatened attack, had
placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> an embargo
on corn along his southern frontier. This incensed the slave
traders, who drew their supplies from Darfur, and a further cause
of quarrel was the invasion of Bahr El Ghazal territory by Darfur
troops in pursuit of slaves. Zubeir accordingly prepared for an
invasion of the province. The Egyptian Government, seeing the
danger of his acquiring fresh strength, determined upon taking the
conquest into their own hands, giving out as a pretext that the
repeated hostile expeditions of the Sultan had made it necessary to
occupy Darfur. Two expeditions were accordingly organisedâone from
the north under the command of Ismail Yagub Pasha, and one from the
south under Zubeir. In one of the ensuing battles the Sultan and
two of his sons were killed, and Darfur fell into Egyptian hands.
Zubeir was made a pasha, but he claimed a right to be made
governor-general of the new province, and his acknowledged power
was likely to make him formidable. His request, however, was
refused, and though at first he intended to assert his
independence, he, in the end, decided to push his claim at Cairo.
Here he was, however, detained,<a id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> his son, Suleiman, of
whom more hereafter, meanwhile taking his place in the
provinces.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Exploration of Darfur and Kordofan,
1874.</span>Darfur having thus become an Egyptian province, the
Khedive sent out two scientific expeditions, composed of staff
officers and attachÃ©s, to report on the capabilities of the
country. These left Cairo on the 5th December, 1874: one, under
Colonel Purdy, was to enter Darfur on its northern frontier; the
other under Colonel Colston, by the east from Kordofan. The latter
expedition was afterwards commanded by Major Prout, when Colston
was incapacitated by sickness. Reports of these expeditions were
compiled by the Egyptian General staff.</p>

<h3>RELATIONS WITH ABYSSINIA.</h3>

<p>The relations between Egypt and Abyssinia have an important
bearing on the history of the Sudan, and in future years are likely
to exercise a still further influence on this portion of
Africa.</p>

<p>The Turks and Arabs never succeeded in subjugating this country,
although many attempts were made to that end. As far back as the
sixteenth century the Turks had seized the port of Zula on the Red
Sea, and in later times Suakin and Massaua; but, though based on
these ports, they could make no headway into the Abyssinian hills,
nor even occupy the coast provinces from Massaua to Suakin. During
the aggressions of Ismail, son of Mohammed Ali, the Egyptians and
Abyssinians came into collision from Kassala to Gallabat, and the
Abyssinians were gradually pushed back to the mountains as their
boundary, being hemmed in on all sides by Turks, Egyptians, and the
tribes of the Galla country.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Massaua transferred to Egypt,
1866.</span>In 1866 Turkey transferred her interest in Massaua to
Egypt in consideration of an increased tribute, and in 1867 the
Khedive claimed authority as far as Zula, which is situated in
Annesley Bay. <span class="sidenote">English expedition,
1868.</span>Early in 1868 the English expedition to Abyssinia took
place, and the Khedive, wishing for the countenance of England in
his present and possible future encroachments on the Red Sea coast,
did all in his power to assist the undertaking. Egyptian troops
were offered to the British Government, though not accepted, and
Kassala and Gallabat were spoken of as possible bases of
operations. All this did not tend towards creating a good feeling
between Egypt and Abyssinia.</p>

<p>When the Khedive, Ismail Pasha, was arranging his Sudan railway
scheme, he proposed to make a branch line to Massawa, which would
necessarily pass through the province of Bogos.</p>

<p>The Khedive claimed that Bogos had been conquered by Mohammed
Ali, though as a matter of fact the borderland only had been held
by the Egyptians, whilst the Abyssinians denied that they had ever
relinquished their rights to the territory. Border war had been
maintained till Said Pasha, the former Khedive, had withdrawn his
troops, and Bogos for many years had remained neutral ground.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1874 there was a certain Swiss resident at
Massaua named Munzinger, who acted as consul for both England and
France. <span class="sidenote">Keren, capital of Bogos, occupied,
1874.</span>Seizing the opportunity of the King of Abyssinia being
at war with the Gallas, the Egyptian Government employed Munzinger
to occupy Keren, the capital of Bogos, with 1,500 men. About the
same time, Egypt also acquired the territory of Ailet, a province
lying between Hamasen and Massaua, by the treachery of the
Governor, who sold it to the Khedive.</p>

<p>Against these acts the King appealed to Europe, and especially
to England, sending as his envoy Colonel Kirkman, a Scotchman, then
in the service of King Johannes, but who had formerly been with
Gordon in China. This mission had no practical result, and the
relations between Abyssinia and Egypt were more strained than
ever.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Port of Zeila purchased by Egypt,
1875.</span>In 1875 the Khedive purchased from the Sultan, for
about Â£15,000 a year additional tribute, the port of Zeila, the
base from which for many centuries Turk and Arab had unsuccessfully
attacked Abyssinia; and in fact acquired at the same time all the
Sultanâs nominal rights to the coast country from near Tajura to a
point on the Indian Ocean, including Berbera, the transfer actually
taking place in autumn, 1875.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>ANNEXATION OF
HARRAR, 1874.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Harrar annexed, 1874.</span>The province
of Harrar was annexed by an expedition under Rauf Pasha, whom, it
may be remembered, Gordon had relieved at Gondokoro in 1874. After
the death of Emir Ahmed, Sultan of Harrar, mentioned by the
traveller Burton, the inhabitants made Khalifa Sitra Emir. He was
deposed after a three daysâ reign by Mohammed; the latter oppressed
his subjects, favouring the Galla tribes, and bullying the
Mussulmans. The people asked the Khedive to take possession, and in
the year 1874, Rauf Pasha, being sent up for the purpose, met with
little opposition. He began his government by the unnecessary act
of causing the Sultan to be strangled. The Sultanâs son went to
Cairo to complain, but nothing was done.</p>

<h3>GORDONâS EXPEDITION TO THE LAKES, 1875.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">1875.</span>Early in 1875 Gordon heard
ill reports of Kabarega, King of Unyoro, who, with the old slave
traders, was meditating treachery. He had already cleared his
province of all those traders on whom he could lay hands, but 50 of
them had escaped him, and taken themselves to the chief above
mentioned. Rionga, Kabaregaâs rival, now received Gordonâs
support.</p>

<p>From the experience gained it became evident to Colonel Gordon
that, in order to open up the Equatorial provinces, an outlet to
the eastern coast must be made. The Nile was found to be
impracticable as a waterway, owing to the numerous rapids, the
obstruction formed by floating masses of vegetation
(<em>sudd</em>), and the scarcity of wood. And as Gordon writes
from Lado: âThe only valuable parts of the country are the
highlands near Mâtesa, while all between this (Lado) and Khartoum
is wretched marsh.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1875.</span>In January, 1875, Gordon
proposed to the Khedive that he should establish a station at
Mombasa Bay, 250 miles north of Zanzibar, and also take Formosa
Bay, or rather a point, where the Tana and Ozi debouch, to the
north of it. In making this proposition he was under the impression
that the Tana was navigable as far as Mount Kenia, and that Lake
Baringo was connected with the Victoria Nyanza, neither of which
suppositions are true. The Khedive on his side proposed the mouth
of the Juba as a base, and fitted out an expedition for the purpose
of occupying it, of which more hereafter.</p>

<p>Gordon now set himself to transport a steamer from Lado to the
lakes. The difficulties he had to contend with were very great,
including the hostility of the border tribes, the obstacles to
navigation, and above all, the useless material of which the
Egyptian troops were composed. The heavy parts of the steamer had
to be carried separately in large Nile boats (nuggars) to Dufile
Falls, above which and up to the lakes the river is navigable. As
he advanced, stations were established along the west bank of the
river. This bank was more secure from attack by natives, as the
mountains came within eight miles of it, and limited the sphere of
their operations; while on the east bank the Bari tribe was very
hostile. A party under Linant, one of Gordonâs officers, was here
surprised and massacred.</p>

<p>As regards the finances of the expedition, Gordon writes from
Muggi, in August, 1874:ââIn a year he (the Khedive) has had Â£48,000
from the province, and I have spent, say, Â£20,000 at the outside,
and have Â£60,000 worth of ivory here.â In September he says that he
was entirely independent of the Sudan Government as regards
supplies, and could raise them from his own resources. In this
month parties were sent out to levy taxes in the shape of cattle on
the hostile tribes, which had a salutary effect in keeping them
quiet.</p>

<p>During Gordonâs absence, the Shilluk tribes in the neighbourhood
of Kodok rose in rebellion against the oppression of the
Government, and, had it not been for the presence of <span class=
"sidenote">Gessi Pasha.</span>Gessi there at the time, Kodok would
probably have been lost. Gessi was an Italian adventurer of great
force of character; he joined Gordonâs staff in the summer of 1874,
having, during the Crimean war, acted as interpreter to British
troops.</p>

<p>The steamer reached Labore in December, great difficulties
having been met with in getting the boats conveying it up the
rapids.</p>

<h3>JUBA RIVER EXPEDITION, 1875.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Juba River Expedition, 1875.</span>In
the autumn of 1875 the Khedive, having long had under consideration
the advantage of opening up a line of communication from the Indian
Ocean to the central provinces, sent out what is known as the Juba
River Expedition. The command was given to McKillop Pasha (an
English naval officer who died in 1879, and he was accompanied
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> Colonels Ward
and Long, the former to survey the harbours along the coast and the
latter to command an inland expedition. Colonel Gordon was to
co-operate from the direction of Victoria Nyanza.</p>

<p>The anchorage at the mouth of the Juba River having been found
inferior, the Expedition ran several miles further south to Port
Durnford and the harbour of Kismayu; but here they encroached on
the territory of the Sultan of Zanzibar. Several interests now
clashed with the success of the enterprise. The British Government
were bound more or less to the Sultan by treaties concerning the
slave trade. The merchants of Zanzibar became alarmed for their
equatorial trade, and the people of Aden for their supplies from
the Somalis, who had been independent till Egypt had acquired a
portion of their territory and levied taxes at their ports. The
result was that, at the instance of Great Britain, the Egyptian
Expedition was given up, but, on the other hand, the Khediveâs
authority along the coast, as far as about 10Â° north lat. was
tacitly acknowledged. Ismail Pasha was thus encouraged to think
that he was entitled to the whole of the Red Sea coast, and could
resist any pretensions of the Abyssinians to a port; while England
believed that she had erected a safeguard against European
settlement on the coast, and had opened the way to a Slavery Treaty
with Egypt.</p>

<h3>WAR WITH ABYSSINIA, 1875-1876.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abyssinia. Arendrupâs Expedition,
1875.</span>During the same period other important events were
passing in Abyssinia. Soon after the acquisition of the Port of
Zeila by the Khedive, an Egyptian force was despatched to Massaua
under Colonel Arendrup, a Danish officer in the Egyptian service.
King Johannes had lately formed a new province (Ginda), which
included the seaboard from the head of Annesley Bay to Amfila Bay
and the Shoho, the Port of Zula, and the district of Ginda lying
south of Ailet. This he had done to ensure the Port of Zula to
Abyssinia, and he made Kirkman Governor of the new province, giving
him the freehold for life. Kirkman accordingly had established his
headquarters at Ginda, and ran up the British flag. In October,
1875, Arendrupâs force, having landed at Massaua, proceeded to
Ginda, and took possession of it, and soon afterwards moved on
Adua, the capital of Abyssinia. <span class="sidenote">Destruction
of Egyptian Army. 11.11.75.</span>King John, however, having
collected a large force, surprised and annihilated the Egyptian
army at Gundet, killing 1,800 men and capturing 2,000 rifles, on
the 11th of November. On the news reaching Cairo, <span class=
"sidenote">Second expedition fitted out, December,
1875.</span>another expedition on a larger scale was immediately
organised, and the chief command given to Ratib Pasha, who was
accompanied by Prince Hassan and several American officers in the
service of the Khedive. The headquarters arrived at Massaua about
the middle of December.</p>

<p>Owing however, to the disorganised state of the Staff and the
difficulties of transport the army did not get under way till the
middle of January, 1876. After tedious marches, it arrived at the
Kaya Khor Pass, near which place, at Gura, <span class=
"sidenote">Defeat of the Egyptians, 7th March, 1876.</span>it was
met and heavily defeated by King John on 7th March, losing nearly
4,000 men and 8,000 rifles.</p>

<p>The Egyptians retired into a fort they had constructed at Kaya
Khor, where, during the next two days, they were assailed by the
Abyssinians. On the 11th of March, however, King John withdrew his
forces, and peace negotiations were entered upon. The Egyptian army
commenced its return march for Massaua on the 19th April.</p>

<p>Ratib now returned to Cairo, leaving Osman Pasha in command at
Massaua.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Walad Mikael.</span>Walad (Wolda) Mikael,
a former Governor of the Hamasen, and hereditary ruler of Hamasen
and Bogos, who had joined the Egyptians during the campaign, now
occupied himself in making a raid against the Hamasen territory of
Abyssinia, which he laid waste in all directions. He then retired
into Bogos and remained for some time at the SenhÃ®t Fort under
protection of the Egyptians, who kept him as a menace to King John.
The latter employed another chief, Shella Khan Alula, to watch him
and to retaliate by ravaging the Bogos and Ailet countries.
Menelik, King of Shoa, meanwhile had marched against King John,
under the impression that he was worsted by the Egyptians, but he
now returned to his own country.</p>

<p>The peace negotiations had come to an abrupt termination on
account of the proceedings of Mikael, but in June, 1876, the King
sent an envoy to Cairo to endeavour to have the boundary fixed, to
secure certain privileges for Abyssinia at the Port of Massaua, and
to obtain an Abuna (high priest) to fill the place of one who had
died; offering at the same time the surrender of Hamasen if Walad
Mikael were given up to him. The Kingâs representative was retained
at Cairo, on one pretext or another, till December, when he was
released through the influence of the British Consul.</p>

<h3>GORDONâS OPERATIONS, 1876-1879.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">1876.</span><span class="sidenote">Gessi
navigates Lake Albert Nyanza, 1876.</span>Early in 1876 Gordon made
preparations for Gessi to proceed to Lake Albert Nyanza with two
lifeboats, while he himself proceeded towards Lake Victoria.</p>

<p>He had now surveyed the river from Khartoum to Dufile, and from
Foweira to Mruli. Gessi started in March,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_239">[239]</span> and succeeded in circumnavigating the lake
in nine days, finding it to be only 140 miles long and 50 miles
wide. The natives showed themselves hostile, and the west coast was
inaccessible.</p>

<p>In January, Gordon had given up all idea of forming an
expedition to meet that proposed from the Juba river; his reasons
were that his troops were utterly untrustworthy and unfitted for
such a task.</p>

<p>In July a steamer, brought up with much difficulty, was at
length put together above the Dufile Falls, and the passage cleared
to the Albert Lake.</p>

<p>A treaty was made with Mâtesa recognising his independence, and
Dr. Emin Effendi,<a id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159"
class="fnanchor">[159]</a> a German by birth, was sent to him as
Gordonâs representative.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gordon leaves for England, October,
1876.</span>In October Gordon left for Khartoum and thence for
England, having handed over the government of his province to
Colonel Prout. He had during the three years successfully checked
the slave trade in the Equatorial provinces, and established the
basis of a sound government, if such could be found under Egyptian
rule. That he could not entirely suppress the slave trade was due
to its huge ramifications, the despicable quality of his troops,
and the resistance offered to all his endeavours by the government
of the Sudan under Ismail Yagub Pasha.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gordon returns to Egypt, February,
1877.</span>In February, 1877, Gordon, under pressure, returned to
Egypt, and the Khedive made him Governor-General of the Sudan,
uniting in one great province the Sudan, the Equatorial provinces,
and the Red Sea provinces; thus giving him a district some 1,640
miles in length by an average of 660 in breadth, with three Wakils
(deputy governors) for Sudan proper, Darfur, and the Red Sea
provinces respectively. The Khedive drew his attention specially to
the suppression of the slave trade and the improvement of the
communications, and gave him powers to negotiate with Abyssinia in
order to end the disputes with King John.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gordon goes to Abyssinia,
1877.</span>Gordon at once proceeded, <em>viÃ¢</em> Massaua, to the
Abyssinian frontier to make a treaty, if possible, with the King.
He found that there was no hope of bringing the matter to a
satisfactory result till a stop was put to the raids of Walad
Mikael. Just now a large portion of Gordonâs troops were withdrawn
for service in the Turco-Russian war, and it was useless for him to
think of using force against Mikael, while the news of a serious
revolt in Darfur required his presence elsewhere. He therefore
agreed to supply Walad Mikael with money and provisions, on
condition that he gave up his attacks on Abyssinia. King John,
taking advantage of this temporary respite, proceeded to attack
Menelik, King of Shoa.</p>

<p>Gordon having visited Bogos, Kassala, Gedaref, and Sennar,
proceeded to Khartoum; here he spent some time in carrying out
reforms, amongst others in giving back to the Ulema their ancient
privileges of which they had been deprived by the late Governor,
Ismail Yagub Pasha. In May, however, he found himself obliged to
start for Darfur.</p>

<p>HarÃ»n, a relative of the late Sultan of Darfur, and a claimant
to the throne, took advantage of the discontent caused by the
misgovernment of the province to raise a revolt in February,
<span class="sidenote">1877.</span>1877. He had a very large number
of men with him as the nomad tribes, who had not helped the Sultan
when Darfur was conquered in 1874, now joined his standard.</p>

<p>These tribes were semi-independent under their own Sheikhs, and
each of them could put from 2,000 to 6,000 horse or camel-men into
the field. They were largely engaged in the slave trade, making
raids on the negro tribes to the south, or buying slaves from other
nomad tribes who lived out of range to the west. Though the traffic
of the large slave caravans had ceased, yet there was still an
extensive trade carried on by small dealers, which it was
impossible to put down.</p>

<p>The Governor of Darfur at this time was Hassan Hilmi Pasha, who
showed no energy, as up to May he had failed to render assistance
to the stations of El Fasher, Dara, Kolkol, and Kebkebia, where the
followers of HarÃ»n had hemmed in the Egyptian garrisons. A force
had, it is true, been sent from Foga for the purpose, but seemed
unable to accomplish the task.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gordon arrives in Darfur, June,
1877.</span>Gordon arrived himself at Foga on the 7th June, having
dismissed, before his departure from Khartoum, Khaled Pasha, who
had been sent to him as second in command.</p>

<p>In addition to the revolt in Darfur, Suleiman, son of Zubeir,
was now at the head of the slave dealers to the south, and, having
a large force at his command, was displaying a threatening
attitude. Shakka was his headquarters, and the nest of the slave
trade in that part. Gordon, considering the country was scarcely
worth keeping, determined to call in all the outlying stations of
Darfur, and merely maintain garrisons along the trunk road through
El Fasher. HarÃ»n was at Tine, and Gordon intended to move against
him with the force at his disposal, reinforced by the garrisons of
Taweisha, Dara, and Kagmar, in all about 3,000 men. In July he was
at Dara, and HarÃ»n retreated to Tura, whence he ravaged the country
to the north, but, seeing Gordon was too strong for him,
disappeared for the time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Meeting with Suleiman, August,
1877.</span>Gordon was at El Fasher in August, but soon after left
for Dara, where he heard that the slave dealers were gathering in
force. Here he met Suleiman and ordered him to lay down his arms;
after some hesitation Suleiman left a large number of his men with
Gordon and returned to Shakka; to this place Gordon followed him
about the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
September, and sent him to the Bahr El Ghazal, while the other
chiefs he dismissed to various places. The slave trade was thus
broken up for the time being in this direction, and very large
numbers of slaves were liberated. There were, however, upwards of
4,000 more slave hunters to be dealt with in the Bahr El Ghazal,
but Idris, the chief of these, was friendly to Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mikael again giving trouble,
1877.</span>Gordon now returned to Khartoum, <em>viÃ¢</em> El Obeid,
and proceeded immediately to Bogos, where he heard that Mikael had
resumed hostilities. In March, Gordon had proposed to King Johannes
that Egypt should retain Bogos, but be answerable for the conduct
of Mikael. Now, however, seeing that the latter was not to be
trusted, he proposed to King Johannes to join him in seizing and
sending him to Cairo. To this Gordon received no answer, and Mikael
continued his aggressive action.</p>

<p>On December 26th Gordon writes:ââI am now waiting for a letter
from Ras Barion, the frontier General . . . I want to get Johannes
to give a pardon to Walad Mikaelâs men, in order that, if I have to
attack them, I may be able to give them the chance of getting away.
If I attack them now, with Abyssinia closed to them, they would
fight desperately.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Visit of Gordon to Harrar, and dismissal
of Rauf Pasha, the Governor, April, 1878.</span>At the end of the
year Gordon, getting no satisfaction, returned to Khartoum by
Suakin and Berber, and, having paid a visit to Cairo, again started
for the Red Sea provinces. Having touched at Zeila, he went on in
April, 1878, to Harrar. Here he found Rauf, the Governor, had been
guilty, not only of oppression, but also of illegal trading on his
own account, and immediately dismissed him.</p>

<p>Fresh trouble now arose on the Abyssinian frontier. In March,
Walad Mikael attacked, defeated, and killed Johannesâs general, Ras
Barion, and got possession of Gordonâs letters, which revealed his
real intentions. Mikael had been enabled to make this raid by the
assistance rendered to him by Osman Pasha, Gordonâs Wakil, who
supplied him with ammunition, and in addition received a
congratulatory letter from the Khediveâs Minister of War, urging
him to press on his conquest. However, he did not follow this
advice; before long he came to terms with the King, and all seemed
quiet for a time, though further troubles were soon to crop up.</p>

<p>In July, 1878, Gordon heard of the revolt of Suleiman, Zubeirâs
son, and despatched an expedition under Gessi to put it down. The
history of Gessiâs campaign will be narrated later on.</p>

<p>The railway scheme at this time occupied the Governor-Generalâs
attention. He considered that the natural outlet for the Sudan
trade was from Berber to Suakin, and that the Nile railway idea was
visionary. Under Ismail Pasha the work had been commenced, but had
come to a standstill in 1877, after an expenditure of some
Â£450,000, and the completion of about 50 miles of line from Wadi
Halfa southward. Gordonâs proposal was to use the river where
navigable, for small steamers, and to lay tramways in the
intervening spaces. The Controllers, however, did not take up his
scheme, and the other affairs of his Government prevented him from
giving further attention to the subject.</p>

<p>At this time the operations for stopping the slave trade were in
active progress, as shown by the fact that within two months 14
caravans had been taken.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1878.</span>Towards the end of 1878, the
Khedive determined to take the Harrar and Zeila districts out of
Gordonâs control.</p>

<p>In December, Walad Mikael started to make his submission to King
Johannes, and the latter entered into further negotiations with
Gordon about the frontier.</p>

<p>One of the Kingâs demands was for an Abuna, or Archbishop. An
Abuna was and is always obtained from the Coptic Church at
Alexandria, and was the only person in Abyssinia who could ordain
priests.</p>

<p>Gordon had some difficulty just then as to the disposal of 1,300
slave soldiers (âBazingersâ) who had remained faithful to the
Government, and finally decided on sending them under Nur Bey
Angara,<a id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class=
"fnanchor">[160]</a> their chief, accompanied by two Europeans, to
a zone of country between Wadai and Darfur. These soldiers had been
originally kidnapped by Zubeir and trained to arms.</p>

<p>Though Gordon had pointed out that the destruction of Zubeirâs
force was the turning point in the slave trade question, he could
get no assistance from Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Slave Convention of August 4th,
1877.</span>On August 4th, 1877, a Convention had been concluded
between Great Britain and Egypt, by which all public traffic in
slaves was at once prohibited, while the private trade in Egypt was
to be suppressed in 1884, and in the Sudan in 1889. It is curious
to note that although it was well known that Zubeir was mainly
responsible for the slave trade of the past 10 years, yet he was
now at Cairo being treated as an honoured guest, and Nubar Pasha
even offered to send him to assist Gordon. The latter, however,
declined the offer, and occupied himself by appointing European
Wakils to all the frontier posts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gordon starts for Kordofan, March,
1879.</span>In March, 1879, Gordon set out for Kordofan. Not only
was the revolt in full vigour in Bahr El Ghazal, but there were
also risings in Darfur and Kordofan. In the former, HarÃ»n had once
more appeared on the scene, and in the latter, the insurgents were
led by Subahi, formerly one of Zubeirâs chiefs, who had taken to
slave dealing on his own account, had murdered the governor whom
Gordon left at Edowa (Eddaiya?), and gone to the hills, where the
Egyptian troops under Hassan Hilmi Pasha were making no efforts to
attack him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Gordonâs reasons
for undertaking his present expedition were to help Gessi, to
prevent partisans of Zubeir in Kordofan sending aid to the slave
dealers, to cut off runaways, and to hinder Zubeirâs bands breaking
into Darfur and joining HarÃ»n. At the end of March he went to Edowa
(Eddaiya), from which station Subahi with 400 men was only four
days distant. Many captures of slave caravans now took place, the
total number captured since June, 1878, being 63. Shakka was
reached on 7th April, where a message was received from Gessi,
asking for more troops and ammunition. Gordon now decided that it
would be prudent to reinstate the Sultanâs family in Darfur, in the
person of the son of Sultan Ibrahim, and telegraphed to the Khedive
to send him down, as at that time he was kept at Cairo. In
December, 1877, Gordon had found, imprisoned at Suakin, an
ex-Vizier of Darfur; he had liberated him and sent him back to the
province. Now he appointed him regent until the son of the deceased
Sultan arrived from Cairo, and wrote to HarÃ»n pointing out the
uselessness of his further opposition, and inviting him to come in
and assist to establish the new Sultan. In a letter written at this
time he makes the following observation:ââIf the liberation of
slaves takes place in 1884 [in Egypt proper], and the present
system of government goes on, there cannot fail to be a revolt of
the whole country. . . . It is rather amusing to think that the
people of Cairo are quite oblivious that in 1884 their revenue will
fall to one-half, and that the country will need more troops to
keep it quiet. Seven-eighths of the population of the Sudan are
slaves, and the loss of revenue in 1889 (the date fixed for the
liberation of the slaves in Egyptâs outlying territories) will be
more than two-thirds, if it is ever carried out.â</p>

<p>Gordon, leaving Shakka in April, went by Kalaka, Dara, El
Fasher, to Kolkol, which he reached on 26th May; here he relieved
the garrison, and returned to El Fasher. At the latter place he
heard from Gessi of the capture of Suleimanâs stronghold, and was
about to start for Khartoum, when learning that a force of Zubeirâs
men was <em>en route</em> for Darfur, he returned to Taweisha, and,
<span class="sidenote">Gordon meets Gessi, June 25th,
1879.</span>on June 25th, he met Gessi who informed him that the
last of the rebel bands had been crushed. Leaving Gessi to follow
up Suleiman, Gordon now left for Khartoum.</p>

<h3>GESSIâS CAMPAIGN, 1878.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Revolt instigated by Zubeir,
1878.</span>Before Zubeir had left for Cairo to push his claims to
the Governorship of Darfur, he had made his officers swear that if,
during his absence, he sent them word to conform to the
arrangements he had made under a certain tree, then
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> were to
revolt.<a id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a> He accordingly did send them orders on finding
that his claims were not attended to. The extent of the
insurrection was much larger than generally supposed; the chief
slave dealers had in their plans apportioned out the provinces of
the Sudan among themselves, and even gave out that they would not
stop short of Cairo. They were backed up by numerous Arab tribes,
and were powerful enough to tax the whole strength of Egypt. It was
from the Arabs that most of the slave hunters were drawn, and they
looked with scorn and hatred on the Egyptian rule.</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon wrote:ââThere is no doubt that if the Governments
of France and England do not pay more attention to the Sudanâif
they do not establish at Khartoum a branch of the mixed tribunals,
and see that justice is done, the disruption of the Sudan from
Cairo is only a question of time. This disruption, moreover, will
not end the troubles, for the Sudanese, through their allies in
Lower Egyptâthe black soldiers, I meanâwill carry on their efforts
in Cairo itself. Now, these black soldiers are the only troops in
the Egyptian service worth anything.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">July, 1878, expedition organised by
Gessi.</span>In July, 1878, Gordon, hearing that the son of Zubeir
(Suleiman) had seized the province of Bahr El Ghazal, at once sent
up an expedition commanded by Gessi.</p>

<p>Gessi started up the river, and on his way met with many slave
nuggars, and even Government steamers, plying the slave trade under
the eyes and with the connivance of the Egyptian Wakils. He first
went to Shambe to collect reinforcements, and then struck off in
the direction of Rumbek on the river Rohl. His march was greatly
impeded by floods, and it was not till the first week in September
that he reached the above-named place. Here he heard of the open
revolt of Suleiman, who had surprised and massacred the troops at
Deim Idris, and was laying the country waste in all directions. The
Arabs now began to join Suleiman in large numbers, and his army
soon numbered about 6,000 men, Gessi in the meantime had but 300
regulars, 2 guns, and 700 irregular troops; his communication with
Khartoum was almost closed by the <em>sudd</em> in the river,
which, moreover, together with the rains, caused the whole
surrounding country to be flooded and made marching impossible. He
accordingly fortified himself at Rumbek till November. He occupied
the time in regenerating the province which he found labouring
under gross abuses and a staff of corrupt officials.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">November, 1879.</span>He was at length
able to leave Rumbek on the 17th November, and, after having met
with some hostility from the natives on the River Jur, arrived at
the Wau on 5th December, where he established a station. He found
Suleiman had carried off upwards of 10,000 women and children, and
the inhabitants about Wau were greatly incensed against the slave
dealers. Having received reinforcements and been joined by a
friendly Sheikh, Gessi marched for Deim Idris, which he reached
about the middle of December. <span class="sidenote">Suleiman
attacks Gessi, 28th December, 1879.</span>Suleiman was on his way
towards Shakka, thinking himself protected by the floods from an
attack from the south, but hearing of Gessiâs arrival at Rumbek he
at once turned to attack him with 10,000 men. The attack took place
on the 28th December, but was repulsed with great loss after severe
fighting. <span class="sidenote">Second attack, 12th January,
1879.</span>On 12th January, 1879, Suleiman, having been
reinforced, again assaulted Gessiâs post, and after two daysâ heavy
fighting was again driven back. <span class="sidenote">Third
attack, 28th and 29th January, 1879.</span>Gessi in the meantime
was running very short of ammunition, but in spite of this repulsed
a third attack on the 28th and 29th of January. On 11th March,
having received some ammunition, he attacked the stronghold of
Suleiman, which was constructed of wooden huts and barricades made
of trunks of trees. Having set fire to the whole by means of
rockets he met and utterly routed the brigands as they sallied out,
but had not sufficient ammunition to pursue them. By the beginning
of February, Gessi had cleared off many of the slave dealers, and
had liberated more than 10,000 of their captives; the result being
that confidence was being rapidly restored, and the headmen of
tribes were giving their allegiance to the Government.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Deim Suleiman taken by Gessi, 4th May,
1880.</span>On 1st May Gessi having received further
reinforcements, marched on Deim Suleiman, which he took by assault
three days later, capturing much booty. Suleiman himself escaped,
and took refuge in a village some distance off. On the 9th May
Gessi with 600 men started in pursuit, and after nine daysâ absence
returned to Deim Suleiman in triumph, having taken many of the
slave dealers, although Suleiman, with Rabeh and Sultan Idris, two
noted leaders, had escaped.</p>

<p>Though much had been done, the revolt was not, as Gessi thought,
completely crushed, and in a few weeks, hearing that Suleiman was
meditating a junction with HarÃ»n, he at once went again in pursuit.
On the night of the 15th July he surprised the enemy, and although
he had only 290 men to their 700, he contrived to conceal the fact,
and <span class="sidenote">Suleiman captured, 15th July,
1880.</span>induced Suleiman to lay down his arms. Fearing that, by
plotting with the rebel Abdelgassin, who was at no great distance,
the prisoners might escape, he shot the 11 ringleaders, including
Suleiman, and dismissed their men to their new countries. Gessi had
now broken the neck of the revolt, and aided by the tribes whose
families he had freed from slavery, he hunted down the remaining
bands. Abdelgassin was caught and shot, and only Rabeh escaped to
the west, where he eventually carved a kingdom for himself near
Lake Chad, and was killed by the French in 1901 (<em>v.</em> Baron
Oppenheimâs Monograph).</p>

<h3>GORDONâS MISSION TO ABYSSINIA, 1879.</h3>

<p>In August, Gordon arrived at Cairo and conferred with the new
Khedive, Tewfik, on affairs in Abyssinia. Walad Mikael and
Johannesâs general, Alula, were now plotting a joint attack on
Bogos, and Gordonâs proposal that he should at once go and
endeavour to settle matters with the King was eagerly accepted by
the Khedive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Gordon goes to Abyssinia, 1879.</span>He landed at
Massaua on 6th September, 1879, and finding that Bogos was
practically in the hands of the Abyssinians, started on the 11th to
meet Alula. The next day he heard that Alula, by the Kingâs orders,
had made a prisoner of Walad el Mikael and all his officers, and
that Mikaelâs son had been killed. On the 16th Gordon reached Gura,
the rendezvous, and, at an interview with Alula, requested him to
state the complaints of Abyssinia against Egypt. Alula, on the
18th, replied that he had better see the King himself, and Gordon
accordingly left the following day for Debra Tabor, near Gondar. He
arrived there on the 27th October. On the 28th October, the King
stated his claims as follows:ââYou want peace; well, I want
retrocession of Gallabat, Beni Shangul, and Bogos, cession of Zeila
and Amfila (ports), an Abuna,<a id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and a sum of money from
one to two million pounds; or, if his Highness likes better than
paying money, then I will take Bogos, Massaua, and the Abuna. I
could claim Dongola, Berber, Nubia, and Sennar, but will not do so.
Also I want certain territory near Harrar.â Gordon asked him to put
these demands in writing, and give the Khedive six months for
reply. But the King would give no satisfactory answer. On the 6th
November there was another interview. The King had evidently been
put up to his first demands by the Greek Consul at Suez, who was
with him at the time, and now neither liked to withdraw his
demands, nor to put them in writing. After some further delays, the
King at length gave Gordon a letter and let him go, which he
accordingly did, and started for Gallabat, intending to go to
Khartoum. Before reaching Gallabat, however, the King had him
arrested and brought back through Abyssinia. He reached Massaua,
after much privation, on 8th December, and then ended his
connection with the Sudan and Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Shortly before his departure he had given up the district
Unyoro, and the stations of Mruli, Kodj, Foweira, Keroto, and
Magunga were accordingly evacuated by Egyptian troops. Masindi and
Kisima had been given up two years before. The Somerset Nile was
now the boundary of the Khediveâs territory, and new stations were
formed to defend it, whilst the province of Makaraka was also
incorporated. Dr. Emin Bey had been made Governor of the Equatorial
provinces, with his headquarters at Lado, and under him were the
three Mudirs of Makaraka, Kiri, and Magunga. Many improvements had
been made in these provinces, and Lado was greatly increased in
size and importance.</p>

<p>Rauf Pasha was Gordonâs successor at Khartoum, while a second
pasha was given the government of Massaua and the adjacent coast,
and a third was appointed to Berbera, Zeila, and the Harrar
district. As Gordon pointed out to the Khedive, King Johannes was
too much occupied with internal affairs to be able to give further
trouble on the border for the present; but in the summer of 1880
the Somalis revolted, and Egyptian troops had to be sent to aid the
Governor of Harrar.</p>

<p>Gessi, as Governor of the Bahr El Ghazal, was most successful;
he had completely stamped out the slave trade, done much to
encourage agriculture, and revived to a great extent the ivory
trade.</p>

<p>On the departure of Gordon, however, and in the absence of a
strong central government, the slave dealers again showed
themselves in other parts, and before long slave caravans were once
more on their road to Lower Egypt and the ports of the Red Sea.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Railway scheme again entertained,
1880.</span>Early in 1880 the railway scheme again seems to have
occupied the attention of the Khedive, who then visited the Sudan,
and expressed himself strongly in favour of a line from Berber to
Suakin.</p>

<p>In September, 1880, Gessi, finding his position intolerable
under Rauf Pasha, Governor-General of the Sudan, resigned his post,
and, after having suffered great hardships on the way, on account
of the steamers being stopped by the <em>sudd</em>, he at last
reached Khartoum; meeting with a cold reception there, he managed
to get to Suez, where he soon after <span class="sidenote">Gessiâs
death, 30th April, 1881.</span>died, 30th April, 1881, from the
effects of the suffering he had endured. Lupton Bey, an
Englishman,<a id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class=
"fnanchor">[163]</a> succeeded him in the governorship of the Bahr
El Ghazal.</p>

<p>In April, 1882, the Sudan was reorganised on paper, and was to
be again under one Governor-General with four subordinate governors
for the West Sudan, Central Sudan, East Sudan, and province of
Harrar. Schools and seats of justice were to be established, and
special arrangements to be made for the suppression of the slave
trade.</p>

<h3>INSURRECTION OF THE FALSE PROPHET, 1881.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Mahdi.</span>The next great cause of
disturbance in the Sudan was the appearance of the False
Prophet.</p>

<p>For many years the creed of Mohammed had been making immense
strides in Central Africa, where it seems to have a peculiar
fascination for the native races; and high authorities estimate the
number of converts to this religion at from eight to twelve
millions. The idea of the regeneration of Islam by force of arms
had gained a strong hold over the enthusiasm of these new converts,
and on the appearance of the False Prophet in August, 1881,
thousands flocked to his standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>The person in
question was a Sheikh named Mohammed Ahmed, the son of a carpenter,
and a native of Dongola. He was born about the year 1848, and
educated in a village near Khartoum, where he studied religion. In
1870 he became a Sheikh, and after a short stay at Kaka, near
Kodok, he finally took up his residence on the Island of Aba. Here
his influence much increased, he gradually acquired a great
reputation for sanctity, and in time assembled a considerable
number of dervishes or holy men around him. He augmented his
influence by marrying daughters of the leading Sheikhs of the
Baggara, and by his power and tact succeeded in merging together
the various tribes.</p>

<p>The principles of his teachings were universal equality,
universal law and religion, with a community of goods. All who
refused to credit his mission were to be destroyed, whether
Christian, Mohammedan, or Pagan.</p>

<p>The causes of the rebellion were ascribed toâ</p>

<p>1. The venality of the officials, and the oppressive and unjust
manner of collecting the taxes.</p>

<p>2. The suppression of the slave trade. Most of the supporters of
the Mahdi, more especially the Baggara tribes, owed all their
wealth to their traffic in slaves.</p>

<p>3. The military weakness of Egypt. This was not, however, any
real cause of rebellion, as the troops in the Sudan would have been
sufficient, had they been properly handled.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1881. May.</span>In May 1881 the Mahdi
first advanced his claims to being the prophet foretold by
Mohammed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">July.</span>In July Rauf Pasha, then
Governor of the Sudan, had his attention drawn to these
pretensions. The Mahdi was then living at Marabia, near the Island
of Aba.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">August.</span>In August he publicly
proclaimed his mission during the Feast of Ramadan, and small
parties of troops were sent to dispose of him, but failed to do so.
He first showed himself in force in the neighbourhood of Sennar,
and then took refuge in the Shilluk country, finally taking up his
position at Jebel Gedir, about 90 miles west of Kaka on the White
Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">9th December.</span>A force of 350
regulars, under one Rashid Bey, attacked the Mahdi, but were
defeated with loss.</p>

<p>The latter, having recruited his force, began early in spring to
threaten the province of Kordofan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1882. 4th March.</span>Rauf Pasha was now
recalled, and Abd el Gader appointed in his place. Pending the
arrival of the latter, Giegler Pasha was temporarily appointed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">April.</span>In April a concentration of
troops was directed on Kaka, and 3,000 men collected there, whereby
the garrisons throughout the country were much reduced.</p>

<p>The rebels, taking advantage of this concentration, attacked
Sennar, and had many minor successes in that part of the country,
until they were dispersed by Giegler Pasha, <span class=
"sidenote">May.</span>who arrived about the middle of May.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">11th May.</span>Abd el Kader reached
Khartoum on the 11th May.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">14th May.</span>On the 14th the Egyptian
troops were successful in an action near El Obeid, the result of
which, however, was unimportant.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May Yusef Pasha, Governor of Kodok, was
ordered to march with the force from Kaka against the Mahdi, who
was in the hills at Gedir. After great delays, Yusef set out with a
large disorganised force of several thousand men and swarms of
camp-followers; but the rains had begun, and progress was slow.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">7th June.</span>On the 7th June, the
Egyptian army came face to face with the rebels in a densely wooded
country. A zeriba was commenced, and the troops were formed up in
hollow square, but the rebels broke in upon them, defeated, and
utterly destroyed the whole force.</p>

<p>This crushing defeat placed the Egyptian Government in a
critical position, and gave great impetus to the insurrection.</p>

<p>The Mahdi now sent a portion of his army, under Wad el Makashif,
across the White Nile by the ford of Abu Zeid, to threaten Sennar.
He remained himself for some weeks at Gedir, though detachments of
his following were raiding in Kordofan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">24th June.</span>On the 24th June the
rebels attacked Bara, but were repulsed with heavy loss.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">17th June.</span>On the 17th an attack
was made on Um Shanga, in Darfur, but was likewise repulsed; but
towards Shakka an Egyptian force of 1,000 men was almost
annihilated on the 20th July.</p>

<p>Many minor engagements were fought upon the lines of
communication between Kordofan and Dueim, which resulted in favour
of the rebels.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">August.</span>At the beginning of August
the Mahdi, with the bulk of his forces, was at Jebel Gedir; a
second army was wasting Kordofan; a third stretched along the White
Nile from Dueim to Geziret Aba on the north-east, and from Kaka to
Marabia on the east bank.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">19th August.</span>The rebels were
defeated at Bara, and El Obeid was revictualled.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">23rd August.</span>On the 23rd Dueim was
attacked, but the rebels were here driven back with a loss of 4,500
men; and Makashif, who was advancing on Khartoum, was also defeated
with heavy loss about the same time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">4th, 5th, 6th September.</span>The Mahdi
now took the field in person and advanced on El Obeid. On three
successive days, he made desperate assaults on the garrison, but on
each occasion he was repulsed with great slaughter. The rebels are
said to have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
10,000 men killed, while the Egyptian loss is put down at 288.
These disasters caused great loss of prestige to the Mahdi, who had
never heretofore been defeated when personally leading.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">24th September.</span>A relief column of
about 2,000 men was now sent from Dueim under Ali Bey Satfi, and
was directed on Bara. This column had two engagements with the
enemy, in the first of which it was successful, but the second time
was defeated with a loss of 1,130 men, the survivors making good
their retreat to Bara.</p>

<hr class="decor width3 spaced2">

<p class="sch">EVENTS ON THE NILE FROM 1882 TO MAY, 1898.</p>

<p>In December, 1882, Colonel Stewart (11th Hussars) arrived at
Khartoum with orders to report on the situation. <span class=
"sidenote">1883.</span>His valuable report,<a id=
"FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class=
"fnanchor">[164]</a> dated 9th February, 1883, went thoroughly into
the question of finance and administration, and recommended drastic
reforms, stating that the Egyptians by themselves were totally
incapable of governing such a huge tract as the Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fall of El Obeid, 17th January,
1883.</span>Almost the first event of 1883 was the fall of El
Obeid, on the 17th January. For six months Mohammed Pasha Said had
held out, but was eventually obliged by famine to capitulate. The
gallant commander was shortly afterwards killed by his captors, and
the Mahdi transferred his headquarters to the town.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Abd el Gader Pasha, Governor of Khartoum, was doing
his best to suppress the rebellion in the angle between the White
and Blue Niles, and on the 24th February he beat the Emir Ahmed el
Makashif at Meshra el Dai, and raised the siege of Sennar town for
a time. In response to his former appeal to Cairo for
reinforcements, troops were being collected, and Hicks Pasha was
sent with a crowd of some 10,000, mostly undrilled, Egyptians to
his support, arriving in Khartoum, <em>viÃ¢</em> Suakin and Berber,
on the 4th March.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hicks arrives.</span>Abd el Gader was,
shortly before Hicksâs arrival, superseded by Ala el Din Pasha.</p>

<p>After a strong reconnaissance in force up the White Nile, during
which <span class="sidenote">Battle of Marabia.</span>Makashif was
heavily defeated and killed at Marabia on the 29th April, Hicks
began preparations for an advance into Kordofan on a large scale.
He started in September from Dueim with about 8,200 men, marching
on El Obeid <em>viÃ¢</em> Khor Abu Habl, this route having been
recommended to him as holding much water. The Mahdi, informed of
their approach, collected some 40,000 men and encamped in the
forest of Shekan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Annihilation of Hickâs Expedition, 5th
November, 1883.</span>Misled and betrayed by their guides, and
suffering terribly from want of water, Hicksâs force advanced into
the forest on the 5th November, was set upon by the enemy in
overwhelming numbers and annihilated, some 300 only escaping
death.</p>

<p>The news of this disaster naturally raised the Mahdiâs influence
to the highest pitch, and produced a corresponding depression on
the Egyptian side. At Khartoum, which had been virtually in a state
of siege since July, there was a panic, but De Coetlogon (left by
Hicks with the depot), Power, Herbin, and Hansal (British, French
and Austrian Consuls respectively), collected food and outlying
garrisons, and strengthened the defences by the end of the year.
Sennar was meanwhile again besieged.</p>

<p>The effect of Hicksâs disaster on the Home Government was that
it was decided that the Sudan should be abandoned and the garrisons
evacuated. <span class="sidenote">1884. Gordon
arrives.</span>General Gordon was the man chosen to carry out this
difficult task, and he, accompanied by Colonel Stewart, arrived in
Khartoum on the 18th February, just a month after the proclamation
in that town of the Governmentâs intentions.</p>

<p>Gordon was enthusiastically received at Khartoum, and
proclaimed, in addition to the foregoing, that the suppression of
the slave trade by Egyptian means was now abolished, and that the
Sudan was now independent, with himself as Governor-General. A
large exodus northward consequently took place.</p>

<p>Gordon quickly came to the conclusion that if the Sudan were
evacuated, the only man capable of keeping it in order after the
Egyptians had retired would be Zubeir Pasha. His request for him,
however, was refused by the Government, so Gordon resolved to hold
Khartoum at all costs and crush the enemy if possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the flood of Mahdism was spreading northwards, and
after a fruitless attemptâowing to the rising of the Robatab
tribeâon the part of Captain Kitchener and Lieutenant Rundle to
communicate with and assist Hussein<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_248">[248]</span> Pasha Khalifa, Governor of Berber,
<span class="sidenote">Fall of Berber, 20th May, 1884.</span>this
town was attacked, and, after a certain amount of resistance, taken
by the enemy on the 20th May. Captain Kitchenerâs efforts, however,
in negotiating with the Bisharin and Ababda in the Korosko-Abu
Hamed desert with a view to stopping an advance through this desert
were successful, and a reconnaissance on the left bank of the Nile
along the ArbaÃ®n route from Assiut to Sagiyet el Abd by
Lieut.-Colonel Colvile and Lieut. Stuart-Wortley proved that the
water supply along that route was absolutely insufficient for the
advance of an enemy in this direction. It was therefore certain
that if an advance northwards took place, it could only come by the
Nile, and subsequent events have proved the correctness of this
supposition.</p>

<p>Halfa and Korosko were fortified about this time, and English
troops sent up to Aswan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Action at Debba.</span>In June Heddai,
victor of Berber, advanced down-stream in the direction of the
Dongola province, but was beaten at Debba (5th July, 1884) by a
force of Bashi Bazuks, and again at Tani. Mustafa Pasha Yawer,
Mudir of Dongola, gave rise to some anxiety by his doubtful and
temporising action with regard to the enemy, but these successes
appear to have decided his line of action.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle at Korti, 11th September,
1884.</span>On 1st September he advanced with 400 men against
Heddai, who had been reinforced by Mohammed Mahmud to the total
number of 3,000, and in a smart action close to Korti totally
defeated the Emirs, killing them both. Captain Kitchener, who had
been sent to report on the Mudir, now pushed on, and entered into
negotiations with the great Kababish tribe and their Sheikh Saleh
for assistance in the forthcoming Nile expedition, which had just
been decided on for the relief of Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gordon relief expedition.</span>This
expedition was put in hand in the beginning of August, and the
command of it given to Lord Wolseley. It was composed of nine
battalions,<a id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class=
"fnanchor">[165]</a> a camel corps of four âregiments,â<a id=
"FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class=
"fnanchor">[166]</a> and the 19th Hussars, besides light Artillery
and other details. The major portion was despatched up the Nile in
whaleboats, and it concentrated eventually in December at
Korti.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fighting round Khartoum.</span>During the
advance of the expedition, Gordon employed every means to keep the
enemy at a distance. On the 29th and 31st August his âfighting
Pasha,â Mohammed Ali Pasha, defeated Emir Abd el Gader at Gereif
and Sheikh el Obeid at Halfaya respectively, but five days
afterwards was heavily defeated and killed by the latter at Um
Dibban, whither he had followed him after a third victory at El
Eilafun.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Murder of Colonel Stewart,
&amp;c.</span>This defeat was a heavy blow to Khartoum, and on the
10th September Gordon sent Stewart, Power, Herbin, and some Greeks
downstream on the âAbbasâ steamer to give an account of the state
of affairs to the authorities. These officers were decoyed ashore
and murdered on the 18th near Hebba, at the head of the 4th
Cataract.</p>

<p>On the 29th September Gordon sent three steamers down to Shendi
to meet the British expedition, and these<a id=
"FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a> remained on the river under the command of
Nushi Pasha, fighting and reconnoitring, until the 21st January,
when the British desert column met them near Metemma.</p>

<p>After the defeat near El Eilafun, the Mahdi summoned all the
tribes to the attack of Khartoum, and this city was closely
invested. Omdurman, held by Faragalla Pasha, was repeatedly
attacked, and was obliged by famine, on the fifth day of the new
year, to surrender.</p>

<p>The garrison of Khartoum was now getting weaker and weaker
through famine, and though Gordon despatched cheery messages to say
he âcould hold out for years,â he knew it would be all over with
Khartoum if the expedition did not arrive in time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">River column.</span>On the 28th December
a river column of four battalions,<a id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> one squadron, and
details was sent upstream from Korti, under Major-General Earle,
with the object of reaching Abu Hamed, communicating thence (for
supplies) with Korosko (Major Rundle), and pushing on to seize
Berber.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Desert column.</span>On the 30th December
a desert column, chiefly composed of Camel Corps, total about 1,100
fighting men, left Korti to occupy Jakdul Wells, over halfway to
Metemma. This done, Sir Herbert Stewart (in command) sent back for
more troops and supplies, and the column, increased to about 1,800
fighting men, <span class="sidenote">1885.</span>left Jakdul on the
14th January, 1885. <span class="sidenote">Battle of Abu Klea, 17th
January, 1885.</span>On the 17th a force of about 11,000 of the
enemy, under Abu Safia (or Abd el Mejid?) was encountered and
heavily defeated near Abu Klea (Tleh) Wells, and the column pushed
on to the Nile, which it reached, after another stiff fight near
Abu Kru (Khrug), on the evening of the 19th. On this day Sir H.
Stewart was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>On the 21st a reconnaissance in force of Metemma was carried
out. Gordonâs four steamers arrived during the action, and Colonel
Sir C. Wilson being now in command, after proceeding next day on a
reconnaissance towards Shendi, left Gubat on the morning of the
24th with two steamers for Khartoum.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fall of Khartoum, and death of
Gordon.</span>On arriving there at noon on the 28th, Khartoum was
found to have fallen two and a quarter days previously, the town
having been taken by assault, and Gordon having been killed, just
before dawn on the 26th. The two<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> steamers were both wrecked in the Sixth
Cataract on the way back, and Sir C. Wilson and his party were only
extricated by Lord C. Beresford (on a third steamer) after a hard
fight with a shore battery<a id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> near the tail of the
cataract.</p>

<p>The desert column, now under Sir R. Buller, short in transport
and in numbers, retired to Abu Klea (Tleh), at which point they
beat off the pursuing enemy (16th February), and eventually reached
Korti during March.</p>

<p>The river column had meanwhile ascended the 4th Cataract with
extreme difficulty, and met the enemy near Kirbekan. <span class=
"sidenote">Battle of Kirbekan, 10th March.</span>Here a decisive
action was fought (10th March), in which the Mahdists were
thoroughly beaten, but General Earle was killed. The command
devolved on Brigadier-General H. Brackenbury, and the column
reached Huella (or Khulla), within 30 miles of Abu Hamed, on the
23rd February, having destroyed the village of Stewartâs murderers
on the way.</p>

<p>Here orders were received to turn back, and the column retired,
reaching Merowe on the 5th March.</p>

<p>When the news of the fall of Khartoum reached England, it was
first determined to operate on the Sudan from the Suakin side, and
a British expedition was sent there, together with a force of
navvies, to construct a railway to Berber (<em>v.</em> <a href=
"#Page_257">p. 257</a>). Preparations were also begun for another
Nile campaign in the autumn, and the troops of the late expedition
were encamped for the summer along the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Retirement of expedition, June,
1885.</span>After some months the Government decided to proceed no
further with the Sudan operations, and the whole force<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> was withdrawn, leaving the
country unoccupied south of Kosha. A temporary native Government
was established at Dongola, but it proved of no value, and fell to
pieces on the advance of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Mahdists pushed gradually forward, and by the end of
November came into touch with our frontier field force, now
composed of 1,700 British and 1,500 Egyptian troops. A harassing
month of skirmishes ensued, which was put an end to by the
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Ginnis, 30th December,

of typhus fever on the 22nd June. On proclaiming himself Mahdi he
had nominated four Khalifas to succeed him in order, and had also

<p><span class="sidenote">The Khalifas.</span>The first of the
Khalifas, Abdalla Ibn el Sayid Hamadalla el Taaishi, a Baggara of

<p>The second Khalifa, Ali wad Helu, was a Sheikh of the Degheim
and Kenana Arabs.<a id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> He was fanatical and religious, but his
quarrels with Abdalla did not dispose him in his favour.</p>

<p>The third Khalifaship, which was offered to and refused by the
Sheikh el Senussi, was filled<a id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> by one Adam wad el
Wazir, but appears to have lapsed. The fourth Khalifa was Mohammed
el Sherif, son-in-law of the Mahdi. His men<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_252">[252]</span> having been mostly killed under Wad el
Nejumi, at Toski (1889), he was thereafter often imprisoned by
Abdalla, and was of comparatively small account. He was, however,
considered to be, strictly speaking, next in succession to
Abdulla.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1886.</span>During 1886 the frontier of
Egypt was withdrawn to Wadi Halfa, and the enemy, checked but not
daunted by the fight at Ginnis, worried and raided, and tore up the
railway to their heartsâ content. Numerous small skirmishes
occurred, but no serious fighting was destined to take place for
another three years.</p>

<p>Although the Khalifa was anxious to carry out at once his plans
for the invasion of Egypt, he was prevented by three causes:
firstly, a revolt in Darfur and Kordofan (<em>v.</em> <a href=
"#Page_255">p. 255</a>); secondly, attacks by the Abyssinians
(<em>v.</em> <a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>); thirdly, attacks by
the Kababish.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1887. Action at Sarras.</span>During 1887
the only fighting of importance on the Nile was Colonel Chermsideâs
action of the 28th April, in which Nur el Kauzi and 200 Arabs were
killed at Sarras. A misfortune, however, occurred in the defeat and
death, at Matassi Wells, of Sheikh Saleh and many of his Kababish,
who had repeatedly, by harassing their left flank, prevented
Mahdist reinforcements from coming down the river. This great tribe
was now split up and hunted down by the enemy until it had been
greatly reduced in numbers.</p>

<p>About this time Charles Neufeld, a German merchant, was captured
in the western desert and sent to Omdurman.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1888.</span>The small English force was
now (1st April, 1888) withdrawn from the frontier, and the task of
defending it devolved entirely on the Egyptian Army. A glance at
the history and constitution of the latter will not be out of place
here.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Egyptian army.</span>After the defeat
of Arabi and his army in 1882, Sir Evelyn Wood, aided by a small
but competent staff of officers, began the formation of a new
Egyptian Army. By January, 1883, it consisted of 8 Egyptian
battalions (forming 2 brigades, the first under British and the
second under native officers), 1 regiment of cavalry, and 4
batteries of artillery.</p>

<p>The IXth Sudanese battalion was raised at Suakin in May, 1884,
and in March, 1885, Sir Francis Grenfell became Sirdar.<a id=
"FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class=
"fnanchor">[172]</a> The remaining battalions were raised as
follows:â</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Xth Sudanese, January, 1886.</li>

<li>XIth Sudanese, January 1887 (formed from the Reserve).</li>

<li>XIIth Sudanese, November, 1888.</li>

<li>XIIIth Sudanese, June, 1886.</li>

<li>XIVth Sudanese, March 1896 (disbanded 1902).</li>

<li>15th Egyptian, March 1896 (formed from the Reserve).</li>

<li>16th Egyptian, March, 1896 (formed from the Reserve).</li>

<li>17th Egyptian, 1896 and 1897 (disbanded 1900).</li>

<li>18th Egyptian, 1897 (not complete) (disbanded 1900).</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Besides the
above, there were in 1898 10 squadrons of cavalry, 5 batteries
artillery, 8 companies of camel corps, 3 companies garrison
artillery, &amp;c., besides 13 gunboats. The army has now been
reduced.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Invasion by Wad el Nejumi.</span>At the
end of 1888 the Khalifa made great preparations for the invasion,
and a large force was collected under Wad el Nejumi.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1889.</span>By the end of May, 1889,
Nejumi had reached Sagiet el Abd with some 4,000 fighting men and
7,000 camp followers, the Egyptian frontier force being then about
6,000 men.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle of ArgÃ®n, 2nd July, 1889.</span>On
the 2nd July, Colonel Wodehouse, O.C.F.F.F., engaged the enemy at
ArgÃ®n,<a id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class=
"fnanchor">[173]</a> and, although with much inferior numbers,
advanced with determination to the attack, and inflicted a loss of
1,400.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle of Toski, 3rd August,
1889.</span>A British brigade was now being sent upstream, but
General Grenfell (the Sirdar), who had previously concentrated his
Egyptian forces at Toski, found Nejumi on the 3rd August attempting
to cross his front, and was therefore obliged to attack him without
waiting for the British, whose advance parties had reached
Korosko.<a id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class=
"fnanchor">[174]</a> He stopped him at Toski,<a id=
"FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class=
"fnanchor">[175]</a> on the 3rd August, and with 2 Egyptian and 4
Sudanese battalions (besides cavalry and artillery) routed him
completely. Wad el Nejumi was killed, and his forces were
practically destroyed. Thus ended the Mahdiâs dream of the conquest
of the world.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1890.</span>The victory of Toski had the
effect of crushing for several years any important movement
northwards on the part of the Dervishes, and the recapture of Tokar
in February, 1891 (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>),
caused the Khalifa still more to draw in his horns.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1891.</span>The Shilluks were meanwhile
giving the Dervishes considerable trouble in the neighbourhood of
Kodok, and in 1891 Zeki Tumal was sent against them. Two steamers
had stuck in the sudd in the winter of 1888, and had been taken by
the Shilluks; desperate efforts were now made by the Dervishes to
effect their recapture (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_260">p.
260</a>).</p>

<p>In August, 1891, the Nuers were used as allies by the Dervishes,
and succeeded in killing the Mek of the Shilluks. Soon afterwards,
however, the Nuers turned against their allies and expelled them
from the country south of Kodok, whilst the Shilluks inflicted a
severe defeat on their enemy near Kodok, in December, 1891, and
again in January, 1893. The war was waged with indecisive results
till 1894, when the Dervishes finally crushed the Shilluks and
murdered their Kingâs wife. After that the Dervishes merely kept a
small tax-collecting outpost at Kodok, and the riverain tribes
remained fairly quiet.</p>

<p>During 1891 the Khalifa, alarmed at a rumour of an Egyptian
advance, pretended to be desirous for peace, but in December of
that year he showed his true hand. He had long been aiming at
making the Khalifate a hereditary succession, and finding an excuse
for quarrelling with the Khalifa Sherif, he threw him into prison
and loaded him with chains.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He would, no doubt, have
liked to do the same with the remaining Khalifa, Ali Wad Helu, but
the latter Sheikh had too powerful a following of Degheim and
Kenana, and Abdalla desisted. At the same time, however, he
effected a clean sweep of all disaffected Emirs, and by executing
some and exiling the majority he succeeded in consolidating his own
dominion. His nearest relations were his brother, Yagub, and his
son, Osman Sheikh el Din; of these two he intended his son to
succeed him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1892.</span>In 1892 raids recommenced on
the frontier, and in December a serious raid was only stopped by a
fierce fight at Ambugol, in which Captain Pyne was killed, together
with 26 of his men.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1893.</span>In July, 1893, another big
raid was made by Osman Azrak on the oasis of Beris, and 11 natives
were taken prisoners. As the Kharga, Beris, and Dakhla oases were
thus threatened, posts were established at these places. In
November the Dervishes raided Murrat Wells, and killed Saleh Bey,
Sheikh of a section of the Ababda.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1894.</span>In 1894 little occurred of
importance on the Nile, though the year was memorable for the
capture of Kassala by the Italians (<em>vide</em> <a href=
"#Page_259">p. 259</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1895.</span>In the beginning of 1895 Sheb
oasis was attacked, but the raiders were repulsed, and at the end
of the year an attack was made on Adendan, a village north of
Halfa. These raids, however, were soon to be avenged, for in March,
<span class="sidenote">1896.</span>1896, it was determined to
retake Dongola, and the Egyptian Army was concentrated along the
frontier by the end of that month. This decision was mainly taken
with a view to assisting the Italians, who had been heavily
defeated at Adua (1st March, 1896) by the Abyssinians, and whose
right flank was threatened by the Dervishes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Escapes from Omdurman.</span>Reference
must here be made to the successful escapes of three Europeans from
Omdurman: Father Ohrwalder in December, 1891; Father Rossignoli in
October, 1894; and Slatin Bey in February, 1895. These gave most
valuable accounts of affairs at Omdurman, and besides corroborating
information already gained, the latter, in particular, threw a
vivid light on the state of the Dervish power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Egyptian advance.</span>On 20th March (1896) an advanced
Sudanese brigade occupied Akasha, and on the 1st May a cavalry
skirmish with the enemy took place near this spot. The railway was
quickly pushed on across the Batn el Hagar, <span class=

artillery, and on the 23rd of the same month the army marched into
Dongola, the enemy, under Wad Bishara, refusing to meet them in the
open, and bolting southwards in a disorganised rabble. The retreat
was quickly turned into a rout by the pursuing troops, and the
river was occupied up to Merowe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1897.</span>The railway to Kerma was
completed on the 4th May (1897), and prior to its completion the
construction of a new railway from Halfa to Abu Hamed was commenced
across the Korosko Desert. <span class="sidenote">Capture of Abu
Hamed, 7th August, 1897.</span>Abu Hamed was taken after a sharp
fight on the 7th August by a flying column<a id=
"FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class=
"fnanchor">[178]</a> under Major General Hunter, and Berber was
occupied by friendlies on the last day of that month, the Dervishes
evacuating it at our approach. <span class="sidenote">Occupation of
Berber, 6th September, 1897.</span>The occupation was quickly
confirmed by the regular troops (6th September), and four gun-boats
were dragged, under circumstances of exceptional difficulty, up the

<p>The army was then placed in occupation of the river from the

enemy to recapture Berber, it was concentrated about this place in
<span class="sidenote">1898.</span>January, 1898. The railway

<p class="sch">THE REMAINDER OF THE SUDAN FROM 1882 TO MAY,
1898.</p>

<hr class="decor width12 spaced2">

<h3><a id="p2c05a"></a>(<em>a.</em>) DARFUR, KORDOFAN, AND DAR
FERTIT.</h3>

<p>The flame of the Mahdiâs rebellion quickly reached Darfur in
1882, and the prophet lost no time in attacking the Government
posts, which were at that time, it will be remembered, under Slatin
Bey. Madibbo, the insurgent Sheikh of the Rizeigat, attacked and
occupied Shakka in July, but on following up his success was met by
Slatin at Injeleila, near Dara, and was twice heavily beaten by
him. Slatin then retired to El Fasher to concentrate, and succeeded
in repulsing the enemy from Um Shanga.</p>

<p>Early in 1883 a message was sent to Slatin from Khartoum,
ordering him to nominate a local Sultan as King of Darfur, and to
retire on Dongola <em>viÃ¢</em> Kaja. The tide of Mahdism gradually
flooded Darfur, in spite of Slatinâs gallant efforts to stem it. He
fought 27 battles in various parts of his province, but his own
troops by degrees fell away from him, themselves infected with the
new faith. After certain proof had been adduced of the disaster to
Hicksâs expedition, the last remnant of loyalty flickered out from
Slatinâs troops, <span class="sidenote">Surrender of
Slatin.</span>and the Bey found himself obliged to surrender at
Dara in December. He was sent to El Obeid, under the name of the
Abd el Gader, and thence to Omdurman, where he remained a prisoner
until his escape in 1895.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Zogal made Emir.</span>Zogal,<a id=
"FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class=
"fnanchor">[181]</a> formerly Mudir of Dara, was now appointed
Dervish Emir of the province. His first act was to take El Fasher,
a garrison of 1,000 men and 10 guns, still holding out under Said
Bey Guma, and, this accomplished<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> (15th January, 1884), he
devoted his time to reducing Jebel Marra, where the loyal hill
population gave him considerable trouble.</p>

<p>On the death of the Mahdi in June, 1885, Madibbo and his
Rizeigat revolted against the authority of the Khalifa. Karamalla,
Emir of Bahr el Ghazal, thereupon advanced against him and defeated
him. Madibbo fled to the Beni Helba Arabs, who protected him, but
he was eventually caught, taken to El Obeid, and executed.</p>

<p>Zogal had several times been suspected of too great
independence, and he was often summoned to Omdurman. At first he
refused, but in the end he went, and was imprisoned on his arrival,
being liberated shortly afterwards. He did not return to Darfur
until after the defeat of the Khalifa at Omdurman.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Yusef, Emir of Darfur.</span>Sultan Yusef
succeeded him as Emir of Darfur, but on Karamalla and Katambura
(Waterbuck), the latter being Karamallaâs trusted General, raiding
from Bahr el Ghazal into Darfur territory, Yusef protested
strongly, and the quarrel developed rapidly into war.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1887.</span>In May, 1887, Zayid, the
temporary ruler of Jebel Marra and former slave of Sultan Mohammed
Fadl, came to Yusefâs assistance, and beat Katambura, with great
slaughter, near El Taweisha. Karamalla then withdrew to Injeleila,
entrenched himself there, and sent to Omdurman for reinforcements.
Osman wad Adam (Ganu), sent to his assistance with a large force,
reached Shakka, encountered the Darfurians near Dara, and forced
them back (26th December). A second battle was even more
disastrous, for Osman Ganu routed Zayid completely and entered El
Fasher. <span class="sidenote">Death of Yusef and Zayid.</span>The
two Sultans fled to the hills, but were shortly killed. Hereupon
the brothers of Yusef appealed to the Sultan of Wadai for help
against Osman. The Sultan applied to the Senussi for advice; but
the Sheikh refused to interest himself in the matter unless he were
attacked by the Mahdists, so the Sultan of Wadai declined.
<span class="sidenote">1888. Abu Gemmeiza.</span>The Darfur chiefs,
however, found a ready ally in the shape of Abu Gemmeiza, Sheikh of
the Masalat tribe, and the rising against the Mahdists began to
swell in numbers. Wild rumours spread over the Sudan of the advent
to power of a great Anti-Mahdi, but although the latter destroyed
nearly half of Osman Adamâs force (October, 1888) at Kebkebia, his
forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> were
themselves destroyed in a fierce battle fought close to El Fasher
on the <span class="sidenote">1889.</span>22nd February, 1889. Abu
Gemmeiza died next day, and the movement, which had at one time
threatened to assume immense proportions expired by itself. Thus
for some time to come the Dervish power was again supreme in
Darfur.</p>

<p>During these years Kordofan had been, more from necessity than
from choice, passively Mahdist, and submitted peacefully to the
Dervish yoke.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1891.</span>In 1891 Kordofan and Darfur
became again disturbed, and various ineffectual risings took place.
Sultan Abbas succeeded in turning the Dervishes out of the Jebel
Marra district, and governed in his brother Yusefâs stead; but the
Khalifa appears about this time to have considered Darfur as too
far off for active interference, and seems to have acquiesced in
this state of things.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1892.</span>In April, 1892, some Degheim
and Kenana Arabs in Kordofan became dissatisfied with Abdallaâs
rule and deserted, but the Khalifa took no notice, finding probably
that dealing with the men of a prospective successor, Ali wad Helu,
was too delicate a matter in which to take a strong line.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1893.</span>A year afterwards a certain
western Saint of Sokoto, Abu Naal, Muzil el Muhan, collected many
followers, and for a time was considered as directly threatening
the Khalifaâs power. His advance, however, was chiefly confined to
the despatch of abusive letters, and the movement died out by
itself by the end of 1893.</p>

<p>After that date Kordofan and Darfur remained uneasy under the
Khalifaâs hand, and Mahmud, later defeated and captured at the
Atbara, was for several years engaged with much success in
suppressing insurrections in Kordofan. By 1898, however, the only
Dervish garrisons in Kordofan were at El Obeid and Bara, whilst
Darfur had, with the exception of a small and hemmed-in garrison at
El Fasher, been evacuated by the Mahdists. The people of both these
provinces were heartily sick of Dervish misrule, and it was
believed that they would welcome with joy a change of masters.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Summary of the History of Dar
Fertit</span>.</h4>

<p>Dar Fertit is a large tract of country to the south of Darfur
and separated from that country by a strip of desert; it formerly
contained many sultans, sometimes one of these reigning over
several others.</p>

<p>These sultans were independent, but paid tribute in slaves and
ivory to the Darfur sultans; failing which the Darfurians used to
make raids into the country. The Fertitawis sometimes repulsed
these raids, and sometimes not.</p>

<p>Zubeir Pasha went to the Bahr El Ghazal as a trader about 1869,
and gradually seized all the zeribas, and made himself absolute
ruler of the country, including Dar Fertit and Hofrat El Nahas
district, which ceased to pay tribute to Darfur.</p>

<p>The Government then sent Bellal to take over Dar Fertit from
Zubeir. Zubeir, however, fought and repulsed him. Bellal himself
was captured and died in Zubeirâs zeriba (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_235">p. 235</a>). Zubeir, by making valuable presents to
those in authority, and by showing that Bellal was entirely to
blame for what had occurred, succeeded in having the matter
reported to Khartoum in its most favourable aspect, with the result
that he obtained full pardon and was made Governor of Bahr El
Ghazal.</p>

<p>After three years, Zubeir advanced against Shakka, and took it;
this was one of the four divisions of Darfur (which were Fasher,
Dara, Kebkebia, and Shakka).</p>

<p>After this Zubeir wrote to the Government, asking for someone to
go to take over the country. They sent Bimbashi Mustafa Bey Abu
Kheiran with troops, and on their arrival they, acting with Zubeir,
conquered the other three provinces of Darfur. The Egyptian troops
commanded by Ismail Pasha Ayub arrived shortly after, and with
these was sent Hussein Pasha Hilmi as Governor-General of Darfur
and Dar Fertit, the latter being garrisoned by irregulars under
Suleiman Zubeir.</p>

<p>At the same time Bahr El Ghazal was put under Ibrahim Bey
Fauzi.</p>

<p>Hussein Pasha Hilmi was succeeded by Messadaglia Bey, and he in
turn by Slatin Bey.</p>

<p>Hofrat El Nahas was detached from Dar Fertit, and with Kebkebia,
Kejma and Kulkul were put under El Nur Bey Angara,<a id=
"FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class=
"fnanchor">[183]</a> subject to the Governor-General of Darfur
(<em>i.e.</em>, Slatin Bey), and the remainder of Dar Fertit,
including Faroge, Telgona and Ringi, under Lupton Bey till the time
of the Mahdi.</p>

<p>During the Mahdia Karamalla Kirkesawi was made Emir of the Bahr
El Ghazal; he took Dar Fertit and brought Lupton Bey, who had
succeeded Ibrahim Bey Fauzi, to Khartoum, the Emir Mohd. Zogal
taking over Darfur.</p>

<p>After Karamallaâs visit to Dar Fertit, the country ceased to pay
any tribute to the Mahdi. It was left unvisited till its
re-occupation by the Anglo-Egyptian Government, when flags were
sent to, and accepted by, some of the more important sultans.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span><a id=
"p2c05b"></a>(<em>b.</em>) THE EASTERN SUDAN.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">1883.</span>The Mahdist rising in the
Eastern Sudan began towards the middle of 1883, when Osman Digna
collected the powerful Hadendoa and other tribes and invested
Suakin. The outlying Egyptian garrisons in these parts included
Sinkat, Tokar, Kassala, Gira, Gedaref, Gallabat, and one or two
smaller posts in Northern Abyssinia, and by the end of the year
they were mostly besieged by the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Suakin reverses.</span>In October, 1883,
a reinforcing party for Sinkat was cut off by the enemy, and on the
4th November a party intended for Tokar met with the same fate,
Commander L. Moncrieff, R.N., being among the killed.
Reinforcements from Cairoâ2,620 men, mostly constabularyâwere
despatched under Colonel Valentine Baker, but before he reached
Suakin another disaster occurred on the 2nd December, by which
nearly 700 men were cut to pieces near Tamanib. Baker started in
January, 1884, to relieve Tokar, but on arriving at <span class=
"sidenote">El Teb, 4th February, 1884.</span>El Teb his force of
3,700 men was attacked by 1,200 Arabs. His troops behaved like
sheep; they were seized with a panic, made no resistance, and were
butchered to the number of 2,300, Baker and most of his English
officers escaping with the utmost difficulty. 3,000 rifles and four
Krupp guns fell into the enemyâs hands (4th February).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fall of Sinkat.</span>On the 8th February
Tewfik, commander of Sinkat, spiked his guns and fought his way
out, but he and the whole of his gallant garrison were cut to
pieces.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">British expedition, El Teb, 29th
February, 1884.</span>General Graham was thereupon sent with a
small British expedition of 4,000 to relieve Tokar, and having
gained a brilliant victory at El Teb (29th February), succeeded in
his task, and sent 600 of the Suakin Egyptian garrison back to
Cairo. <span class="sidenote">Tamai, 13th March, 1884.</span>On the
13th March Graham advanced again, and, beating the enemy thoroughly
at Tamai, swept them back into the hills. The idea was then mooted
of a dash across to Berber, but it was eventually dropped, and
Grahamâs troops retired, Major Chermside being appointed
Governor-General at Suakin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fall of Gedaref.</span>In April the
garrison of Gedaref made terms with the enemy and surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abyssinian Mission.</span>In order to
evacuate Kassala and Amadib, the help of King John of Abyssinia was
now called in, and in June Admiral Sir W. Hewett, R.N., and Mason
Bey, visited him and concluded a treaty to this effect, by which he
was to have Bogos and Keren if he succeeded in his task. Later on
he agreed also to relieve Gira and Gallabat.</p>

<p>Kassala had been besieged since November, 1883, and was
beginning to feel hard pressed. Its garrison consisted of 1,600
regulars and 2,300 irregulars, including a force of Bashi-Bazuks,
under the command of Ahmed Bey Iffat; the Beni Amer and Hamran
tribes in the neighbourhood were also loyal.</p>

<p>In August Mason Bey, now Governor of Massaua, ordered Ahmed Bey
Iffat to retire; but this was found to be impossible, as more than
half the garrison was composed of natives of the district. John now
proposed to relieve Kassala, but he was told that the case of
Gallabat was more urgent; he therefore began his preparations, and
Bogos was handed over to him on the 12th September.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Evacuation of Berbera, Zeila, and Harrar.
1885.</span>During this latter month Great Britain took over
Berbera and Zeila from Egypt, and in November Harrar was handed
over to the natives and the evacuation began. 6,500 of the garrison
were sent down to the coast without incident, and, under the
auspices of Majors Hunter and Heath, a new government was
established under the native Emir Abdullahi Mohammed Abd El
Shakur.</p>

<p>[Harrar, it may be noted here, remained under its Emir till the
beginning of 1887, when Abdullahi was decisively defeated at
Chalanko by Menelik, and the town occupied by the Abyssinians.]</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Second British expedition, 1885.</span>On
the fall of Khartoum becoming known another British expedition,
assisted by Indian and Australian troops, was despatched to Suakin
under the command of General Graham. Its objects were to crush
Osman Digna, to occupy the Hadendoa country, to make a railway
towards Berber (at all events as far as Ariab), and to prepare for
the opening of the Suakin-Berber road when the Nile Column had
captured Berber.</p>

<p>The expedition, numbering 13,000 men, arrived at Suakin on and
about the 12th March, and remained for a couple of months.
<span class="sidenote">Tofrek, 22nd March, 1885.</span>During this
time it fought several actions, at Hashin (20th March), Tofrek
(McNeillâs zeriba, 22nd March), and Tamai (3rd April), but none of
these were decisive. The railway was carried as far as Otao, but on
the retirement of the expedition (17th May) it was abandoned.</p>

<p>At the end of November, 1884, the garrison of Gallabat joined
hands with the Abyssinians, and decisively beat the Mahdists.
<span class="sidenote">Relief of Gallabat, Amadib, Gira, and
Senhit.</span>They were definitely relieved in February, 1885, and
retired to Massaua <em>viÃ¢</em> Abyssinia. Amadib and Gira were
also relieved, in April and July, 1885, respectively, and the
garrison at Senhit<a id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184"
class="fnanchor">[184]</a> handed over their post to Abyssinia on
the 19th April.</p>

<p>Colonel Chermside now wrote pressing letters to John, urging him
to relieve Kassala at once, and promising 10,000 rifles in the
event of his success; Ras Alula, Johnâs most valiant general,
therefore began to move in September. <span class="sidenote">Fall
of Kassala, 30th July, 1885.</span>Meanwhile, however, the gallant
garrison had been starved into submission, and the town fell on the
30th July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>Osman Digna came
towards Kassala in August, but the Abyssinians and Beni Amer
attacked him with great determination at <span class=
"sidenote">Kufit, 23rd September, 1885.</span>Kufit (23rd
September) and utterly routed him, killing 3,000 of his men.</p>

<p>Egypt had on the 6th February handed over Massaua to the
Italians, at which the Abyssinians, deeming it an infraction of the
Hewett treaty, were seriously annoyed. In consequence Ras Alula
refused, after the fight at Kufit, to resume operations against the
Mahdists, and retired.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1886.</span>In the beginning of 1886
Osman Digna once more tried to stir up strife in the neighbourhood
of Suakin. The tribes, however, did not greet him cordially, and
the attitude of the Amarar, Ashraf, and Habab was doubtful. As the
year wore on, the Amarar fought against Digna, shut him up in
Tamai, and beat him there (6th September). As the Beni Amer,
Bisharin, etc., were showing signs of coming in, Osman Digna
escaped, and took refuge in the rich delta of Tokar. Here he
remained quiet for another year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1887.</span>In June, 1887, the
Abyssinians under Ras Adal advanced into Gallabat, and beat the
Dervishes under Wad Arbab, killing the latter. On reinforcements
being sent by the Khalifa, under Yunes el Degheim, Ras Adal
announced his intention of invading the Sudan with a large army.
Abdalla responded by sending 87,000 men, under Abu Anga and Zeki
Tumal, against Adal, <span class="sidenote">Battle of Debra
Sin.</span>and a great battle was fought in August, 1887, at Debra
Sin, 30 miles from Gondar. The Abyssinian army was completely
routed, and the Dervishes entered and sacked Gondar. A slight
side-issue arose for the moment in the shape of one Nebi Isa, a
prophet, who arose at Gallabat in Abu Angaâs rear, but although
many Dervishes, including Yunes, believed in him, as opposed to the
Khalifa, Abu Anga quickly put a stop to the rising by capturing and
hanging the prophet. Other risings occurred on the Blue Nile, among
the Rufaa and other tribes, but they were soon suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1888.</span>At the end of the year Osman
Digna advanced again and besieged Suakin. He was, however, beaten
in detail, <span class="sidenote">Action of Handub.</span>and fell
back on Handub. The latter place was attacked by Colonel Kitchener
with some irregulars on the 17th January, 1888, but the attack did
not succeed, and Colonel Kitchener received a serious wound in the
face.</p>

<p>Fighting continued at intervals during the whole year round
Suakin. Abu Girga<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185"
class="fnanchor">[185]</a> arrived, but retired again. At last
reinforcements were sent from Cairo, including a British
contingent,<a id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class=
"fnanchor">[186]</a> and Sir Francis Grenfell took command.
<span class="sidenote">Gemmeiza, 20th December, 1888.</span>A
decisive action ensued just outside the walls of Suakin (battle of
Gemmeiza, 20th December, 1888), in which the enemy were completely
defeated. In the following year a certain amount of local fighting
went on near the town, but the tribes were becoming exhausted, and
Osman was losing some of his influence.</p>

<p>King John of Abyssinia was meanwhile vowing vengeance for the
defeat at Debra Sin, and in April of 1888 a sham Abyssinian
deputation visited Omdurman, nominally to bring the submission of
Ras Adal, but in reality to spy out the land. Abu Anga advanced
again, and was at first successful, but in July Ras Adal smote him
hip and thigh, and the Dervish general<a id=
"FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class=
"fnanchor">[187]</a> died in the following January, whilst Ras Adal
became King of Gojjam, under the name of Tekla HaimÃ¡not. King John
was now determined to capture Gallabat and advance on Omdurman; he
therefore left Gondar at the end of February, and advanced against
Matemma, the capital of Gallabat. Zeki Tumal had fortified this
town, and held it with 60,000 men; <span class="sidenote">Battle of
Matemma, 9th March, 1889.</span>but the Abyssinians surrounded and
overwhelmed them (9th March). During the last stage of the fight,
however, <span class="sidenote">Death of John.</span>King John was
killed by a stray bullet, whereupon his army retired at once. The
Dervishes harassed their retreat and captured the body of their
monarch, so to all intents the result amounted to a serious
Abyssinian reverse. The Abyssinians are said to have numbered
87,000 men, and outnumbered the Dervishes, <em>vide</em> <a href=
"#Page_108">p. 108.</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Accession of Menelik.</span>On hearing of
this, Johnâs rival, Menelik of Shoa, seized the throne and
proclaimed himself Negus Nagasti, shortly afterwards making a
treaty of friendship with the Italians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1890. 1891.</span>During 1890 Handub was
still occupied by the enemy, but in the first days of 1891 Colonel
Holled Smith, then Governor, attacked and occupied it during the
absence of Osman Digna (27th January). He then followed up his
advantage by seizing Trinkitat and Teb, and on the 19th February,
after a sharp fight with the enemy at Tokar, <span class=
"sidenote">Reoccupation of Tokar, 19th February, 1891.</span>he
occupied the ruins of that town and the village of Afafit, and
drove Osman Digna back to Temerin.</p>

<p>This action and its results were a heavy and, as it proved, a
final blow to the Dervish power in the direction of Suakin. Trade
was reopened between Suakin and Berber in the summer of 1891, and
although Osman Digna threatened reprisals, the tribes were getting
tired of Mahdist rule, and refused to respond to his overtures.
<span class="sidenote">1892.</span>Raids occurred on a small scale
near Tokar and Sinkat during 1892 and 1893, but led to no definite
action.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Italians on the scene.</span>Meanwhile
the Italians had been steadily increasing their sphere of
operations from Massaua, and by a protocol of the 15th April, 1891,
had defined the northern frontier of their new colony of Eritrea as
starting from Ras Kasar on the Red Sea coast, and thence proceeding
in a south-westerly direction to the Atbara, passing east of
Kassala. A further proviso enabled the Italians to take and occupy
Kassala (if they could), with a small section of Egyptian
territory, on condition that they were to hand it over to Egypt if
required.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1893.</span>During 1893 the Dervishes,
alarmed at the growth of the Italian power, determined to invade
Eritrea, and a strong<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_259">[259]</span> force proceeded eastwards from Kassala
(then under the command of Musaid Keidom,<a id=
"FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class=
"fnanchor">[188]</a> who had superseded Abu Girga in 1891) with
that object. <span class="sidenote">Battle of Agordat, 21st
December, 1893.</span>The Dervish force of about 12,000, under
Ahmed Ali, arrived at Kassala in November, and pushed forward
towards Agordat, an Italian post more than half-way to Massaua.
Here Colonel Arimondi, with a native force of only a little over
2,000 men, with 42 officers, met them and inflicted a severe defeat
on them (21st December, 1893), killing Ahmed Ali and routing the
force completely.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1894. Capture of Kassala, 17th July,
1894. 1895. 1896.</span>In the following July, Colonel Baratieri,
with 2,510 men, made a fine forced march from Agordat, and
surprised and took Kassala on the 17th of that month. He thereupon
commenced fortifying it, and the town was successfully held by the
Italians for nearly two and a half years. The Khalifa was furious,
and ordered Ahmed Fedil and Osman Digna to retake it. Nothing,
however, was done till the 18th March, 1896, when the Dervishes, in
consequence of the severe defeat of the Italians by the Abyssinians
at Adua on the 1st of that month, attacked Sabderat, and were
repulsed. Subsequently, on the 2nd and 3rd April, <span class=
"sidenote">Mokram and Tukruf, April, 1896.</span>they fought two
severely contested actions at Mokram and Tukruf, just outside
Kassala, but on both occasions they were decisively beaten by the
Italians under Colonel Stevani, and were forced to retreat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Indian brigade, 1896.</span>The only
event of importance that took place at Suakin in 1896 was the
arrival of an Indian brigade in May, to replace the Egyptian
garrison called to the Nile, and to act as a menace to the Khalifa
from the Eastern Sudan. No opportunity for fighting occurred, and
the Indians left for home in December.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1897.</span>In consequence of the
occupation of Berber in September, 1897, the Suakin-Berber road was
once more opened for trade and transport, and the 4th Egyptian
Battalion passed over it in security in the last days of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kassala reoccupied by Egypt.
1898.</span>On the 25th December, 1897, the town of Kassala was
taken over by Egypt, and garrisoned by the 16th Battalion, &amp;c.,
under Colonel Parsons. The Sheikh Said Ali El Morghani was brought
from Suakin to the holy place of his ancestors, the Khatmia, just
outside Kassala, and this act had the result of still further
alienating Dervish influence from the neighbourhood. Successful
actions were also fought by the friendlies at Asubri, Goz Regeb, El
Fasher, and El Sofeiya. The garrison of Kassala rendered valuable
assistance by capturing the Dervish outpost at Abu Deleig and in
destroying the remnants of the fugitives from the battle of the
Atbara in April, and Osman Digna himself only just escaped capture
by a force of friendlies under the late Major Benson. Ahmed Fedil,
at Gedaref, in order to cover the retreat of these fugitives,
despatched a force to the Atbara which did not, however, proceed
further north than Mogatta.</p>

<h3><a id="p2c05c"></a>(<em>c.</em>) BAHR EL GHAZAL AND
EQUATORIA.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">1882.</span>In the Bahr El Ghazal the
first outbreak in favour of Mahdism occurred at Liffi, on the 18th
August, 1882. The people had been long suffering under the cruelty
and injustice of their âDanaglaâ rulers sent from Khartoum, and
part of the Dinka tribe rose steadily under Sheikh Jango to upset
the Egyptian Government. Lupton Bey, however, was equal to the
occasion, and, advancing from Deim Zubeir (Deim Suleiman), towards
the end of 1882, <span class="sidenote">Lupton defeats the
Dinkas.</span>he defeated Jango with considerable slaughter at
Telgona.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1883.</span>Jango returned with some of
the Emir Madibboâs men early in 1883, but was beaten again near
Liffi. In September, however, he attacked Rufai Agha, Luptonâs
captain, at Dembo, and massacred him and all his men. The Dinkas
then revolted <em>en masse</em>, and blocked the road to Meshra El
Rek and the north, and Lupton, short of ammunition, retired to Deim
Zubeir. The last communication from Khartoum was brought by a
steamer, which arrived thence at El Rek on the 15th August, and
Lupton was thenceforth isolated.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Surrender of Lupton, 1884.</span>On
Karamallaâs<a id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class=
"fnanchor">[189]</a> appointment as Emir of Bahr El Ghazal, he
summoned Lupton to surrender, and this the latter, after gallantly
fighting for 18 months, was obliged, by the defection of his
troops, to do (21st April, 1884). He was christened Emir Abdalla,
and sent to Omdurman, where he died on the 17th July, 1888.</p>

<p>Thus the last vestige of Egyptian authority disappeared in the
Bahr El Ghazal.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Emin and his province.</span>The
Equatorial province, meanwhile, which extended from the Albert
Nyanza to Lado (its capital), and included (since 1881) the
provinces of Bor and Rohl and the northern part of Unyoro, was
under the charge of Emin Bey (Edward Schnitzer, born 1840), who had
been placed there by Gordon in 1879. His forces in 1882 consisted
of two battalions (about 1,300) of Egyptian and Sudanese troops,
and 3,000 irregulars, distributed amongst 40 to 50 stations. This
province was, by the end of 1882, practically the only Egyptian
territory south of Khartoum which was not in sympathy with the
Mahdi.</p>

<p>Karamalla, in May (27th), 1884, summoned Emin to surrender. The
latter, whose men were greatly scattered and, by this time,
considerably disaffected, agreed to send a deputation to surrender,
but meanwhile held out at Lado and Amadi, hoping for
reinforcements. <span class="sidenote">1885.</span>Amadi fell in
March, 1885, and on the 18th April Karamalla arrived within three
days of Lado, and informed Emin of the fall of Khartoum. Emin
thereupon determined to retire south to Wadelai, giving up the more
northerly posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>Karamalla
shortly afterwards was obliged to fall back, owing to disturbances
in the Bahr El Ghazal caused by several Emirs refusing to recognise
the Khalifa Abdalla as successor of the Mahdi, and Emin retired to
Wadelai to open friendly relations with Kabarega, King of Unyoro.
Meanwhile Lado and Rejaf were attacked by negro tribes in the
district, but held out.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1886.</span>On the 26th February, 1886,
Emin received, through the assistance of Kabarega, letters from
Cairo, <em>viÃ¢</em> Zanzibar, in which he was informed by Nubar
Pasha (dated 2nd November, 1885) that the Sudan was abandoned, and
he âmight take any steps he liked should he decide to leave the
country.â Dr. Junker, who had been, off and on, with Emin since
January, 1884, started for Zanzibar, <em>viÃ¢</em> Uganda, in
January, 1886, and his representations in Europe had the effect of
starting the Emin Relief Expedition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1887.</span>During 1886 and 1887 a
mutinous spirit had been brewing amongst Eminâs troops, who wished
to retire northwards instead of southwards. <span class=
"sidenote">Stanleyâs relief expedition.</span>On the 15th December,
1887, the advanced guard of Stanleyâs expedition arrived at the
Albert Nyanza, but, not hearing any news of Emin, went back for
their boat, which had been left at Kilonga Longaâs. Kabarega now,
to whom Emin had sent Casati<a id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> to keep open
communications with Zanzibar, on hearing that Stanley had fought
and defeated the Mazamboni, his allies, changed his friendly
attitude to Emin, thinking that the latter had sent for Stanley to
invade his (Kabaregaâs) country. He therefore treated Casati
outrageously, and expelled him with the greatest ignominy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1888.</span>Stanley and Emin eventually
met at NsabÃ© (Kavalliâs) on 29th April, 1888, and thereupon reports
of a great invading White Pasha spread to Omdurman, with the result
that the Khalifa in July sent up thence three steamers, six barges,
and 4,000 troops to annihilate him. Stanley went back again on 24th
May to pick up his rear guard, leaving Mounteney Jephson and a
small escort with Emin, to escort him round his province, and
settle whether he should retire or not. The Khediveâs âorders,â
which Stanley brought with him, were to the effect that Emin and
his men might come back with Stanley, or stay on at their own
risk.</p>

<p>The garrisons in the south said they would go with Emin, but the
troops at Labore mutinied, and a general revolt broke out, headed
by Fadl el Mula, Governor of Fabbo; thus, on arriving at Dufile,
Emin and Jephson were practically made prisoners (18th August,
1888). <span class="sidenote">Arrival of Dervishes.</span>On the
15th October news arrived that the above-mentioned Mahdists, in
barges, were at hand, and two days afterwards three messengers
arrived from Omar Saleh, the Mahdist commander, to summon Emin to
surrender. The mutineers now released Emin, and decided to fight,
and during November and December continuous fighting went on
between Lado and Dufile. <span class="sidenote">Fall of
Rejaf.</span>Rejaf was taken by the Dervishes on 15th November, and
much loot, several prisoners and captured despatches, ammunition,
tarbushes, and flags, were sent by Omar to Omdurman, whence a
portion was forwarded through Osman Digna to General Grenfell at
Suakin. This gave rise to all sorts of surmises in Egypt as to the
fate of Emin and Stanley.</p>

<p>During December, Eminâs mutinous troops kept the Dervishes at
bay between Wadelai and Rejaf, and eventually severely defeated
them, driving them back to Rejaf. They did not, however, follow up
their victory, and, under the leadership of Fadl el Mula Bey,
remained in and about Wadelai, whilst the Dervishes strengthened
their post at Rejaf.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1889.</span>Meanwhile Emin and Jephson
had retired to Tunguru on the Albert Nyanza, and on 18th January,
1889, Stanley arrived at the lake for the third time with the
remains of the expedition, and was joined by Emin and Jephson in
the beginning of February. Selim Bey, now commander of a portion of
Eminâs rebel troops at Wadelai, on being summoned by Emin, left
Wadelai with 14 Egyptian officers for Tunguru, and on arrival
expressed his contrition for the mutiny. <span class=
"sidenote">Emin returns to the coast.</span>A council held on the
18th determined that the evacuation should take place on the 10th
April, and although Selim Bey, who had returned to Wadelai, where
Fadl el Mula Bey was in command, wrote to say all would return with
Emin to Egypt, they did not arrive in time, and although every
opportunity was given them of overtaking the expedition, no one
appeared. The expedition, numbering about 600 men in all, and 900
women and children, eventually arrived in Zanzibar at the end of
the year 1889.</p>

<p>The Emir Karamalla, after retiring from before Lado and Emin in
1885, to quash disaffections amongst his own Emirs against the
Khalifaâs succession, appears to have become disaffected himself.
So the Khalifa, seeing the danger of trying to hold a huge province
with insufficient forces, and fearing that Karamalla, being a
Dongolawi, might revolt altogether, <span class="sidenote">Bahr el
Ghazal evacuated by Dervishes.</span>ordered the latter to evacuate
the province and retire to Shakka, and eventually to Omdurman. Thus
the land returned to the semi-barbarous state it was in before the
Egyptian occupation, and had peace from the Dervishes for some
years, for the Mahdist operations were chiefly confined to the
neighbourhood of the Nile, and had little effect in the direction
of the Bahr El Arab and interior of the Bahr El Ghazal country.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1890. Shilluk war.</span>In 1890 a
rebellion against the Mahdists sprang up among the Shilluks, in the
neighbourhood of Kodok and the Emir of Gallabat, Zeki Tumal, was
sent thither to quell it, with a force chiefly consisting of the
Gallabat men who had fought so well against the Abyssinians in the
spring of 1889. <span class="sidenote">1891.</span>During the whole
of 1891 the war continued with varying fortunes, the Dervishes on
more than one occasion being heavily defeated, and the
communications between<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_261">[261]</span> Omdurman and Bahr El Jebel being completely
interrupted, much to the anxiety of the Khalifa. Alarmist reports
continued to arrive in Omdurman during 1891 to the effect that Emin
Pasha was at Dufile, advancing northwards with a large body of
Germans, and reinforcements were sent to help Zeki and fight
against the white invaders.<a id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1892.</span>Eventually Zeki got the upper
hand of the Shilluks in the beginning of 1892, but the Dervish
supremacy did not last long. In the summer of that year it was
reported at Omdurman that the Italians were advancing westwards
from Massaua. <span class="sidenote">Fate of Zeki Tumal.</span>Zeki
Tumal was therefore recalled with his army, and was thus obliged to
evacuate Kodok, leaving only a very small guard for the purpose of
collecting taxes.</p>

<p>He was then sent back to Gedaref and Gallabat, to make headway
against the Italians, but on reporting that it was impossible to
invade Eritrea, as the Khalifa wished him to do, he was again
recalled to Omdurman, treacherously seized, thrown into prison, and
ultimately starved to death.</p>

<p>During 1892 reports reached Omdurman from the south of an
European advance on Equatoria from the Zanzibar direction. At this
period there was a small Dervish garrison at Rejaf under Omar
Saleh, and orders were sent to him to withdraw to Bor. This was
effected, but the climate of Bor was so unhealthy, and the natives
so difficult to manage, that <span class="sidenote">Abu Girga
October, 1892.</span>Abu Girga,<a id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> a powerful Emir, whom
the Khalifa was anxious to get rid of, was sent south in October
with 250 men, with orders to send Omar Saleh to Omdurman. Abu
Girga, who had got wind of the Khalifaâs intentions, took the first
opportunity of fighting the other Baggara Emirs who were with him,
and absconding at Kodok.</p>

<p>For several months he was supposed to have deserted the Khalifa
and joined a serious movement in Kordofan which was led by a
western saint, one Muzil el Muhan, and which aimed at the
destruction of the Khalifa. The latter, by the way, had been much
disturbed by this insurrection, and sent his cousin, Ibrahim
Khalil, with 4,000, men to suppress it; but the movement died out
by itself.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1893.</span>Abu Girga eventually arrived
at Rejaf in July, 1893. Probably fearing the Khalifaâs wrath, and
finding the station in a flourishing condition, he sent the Khalifa
a present of ivory as a peace offering; this arrived in August,
1893. Not even a rumour of any fighting having taken place at
either Rejaf or Lado, least of all with any whites, seems to have
reached Omdurman about this time.</p>

<p>On Omar Saleh arriving at Omdurman he assured the Khalifa that
the district was not in danger, and that no Europeans had arrived
there. The Khalifa thereupon despatched his relative <span class=
"sidenote">Arabi Wad Dafaalla.</span>Arabi Wad Dafaalla<a id=
"FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class=
"fnanchor">[193]</a> to take command, to transfer the garrison from
Bor back to Rejaf, and to place Abu Girga in chains (presumably for
his misconduct at Kodok).</p>

<p>It is more than likely that the above-mentioned rumours at
Omdurman of a large Christian force in Equatoria referred to Van
Kerckhovenâs Congo expedition, which had at that time (November,
1892) barely crossed the great watershed; but rumour, especially in
the Sudan, is not to be trusted implicitly.</p>

<p>Arabi Wad Dafaalla arrived in the autumn of 1893 from Omdurman,
with 1,500 men, to supersede Abu Girga, the latter having another
1,500 at Rejaf. Arabi on his arrival wrote to Fadl el Mula Bey, now
in command of some of Eminâs former men, <span class=
"sidenote">Dervishes and Congolese.</span>inviting him to seize
Baert<a id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class=
"fnanchor">[194]</a> and his officers and to bring them to him, but
Fadl had had enough of the Dervishes, and declined; 400, however,
of Baertâs 900 natives heard of this and deserted <em>en masse</em>
to the Dervishes, and some of whom, under Abu Girga, were
penetrating in a W.S.W. direction, and had arrived in the Makaraka
country. Fadl el Mula then took service with Baert.</p>

<p>Baert does not appear to have actually come to blows with the
Dervishes here, but with his thoughts intent on establishing
Congolese posts on the Upper Nile, and even on the Albert Nyanza,
at Kavalliâs, he despatched four companies of Sudanese (400 men)
under Fadl el Mula, to proceed to the Nile and there establish
posts in the interest of the Congo Free State. The exact route of
this party is not known; they appear to have gone first towards the
Nile, in the direction of Rejaf, but hearing the Dervishes had
re-occupied that spot and were close at hand in force, they
retreated to Makaraka and Wandi. <span class="sidenote">Fight at
Wandi.</span>Here they were overtaken and had a severe fight with
the Dervishes, losing Fadl el Mula (killedâsome say taken prisoner
and executed) and about half their number, together with a large
quantity of material of all sorts. <span class=
"sidenote">1894.</span>After this defeat, which took place in
January, 1894, the remaining 200 struck out for the Nile, and
reached it about Muggi and Labore, but finding little food, drifted
towards Wadelai, and arrived there early in February.</p>

<p>To refer now to Uganda for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>Colonel Colvile
was appointed Chief Commissioner in 1893, and arrived there on the
16th November of that year. <span class="sidenote">Defeat of
Kabarega.</span>One of his first acts was to declare war against
Kabarega, King of Unyoro, who had for some time been perpetually
harassing Uganda, and on the second day of 1894 he occupied his
capital. On the 2nd February Major âRoddyâ Owen was despatched with
a small party by boat to Wadelai, and on the 4th he arrived there,
meeting at first with a hostile reception from the banks. He
landed, however, hoisted the British flag, enlisted 50 natives
(Luri) to protect it, <span class="sidenote">Owen at
Wadelai.</span>and learnt from the natives that no white man had
reached the place since Emin Pasha left it in 1888. The garrison
had gone, he was informed, in April, 1893, to join the Dervishes.
Hearing next day reports that a large body of âDervishesâ was
approaching from the north, he retired, and arrived at Kibiro on
the 11th.</p>

<p>From subsequent events it appears that these âDervishesâ were
none other than the remaining 200 of Fadl el Mula Beyâs men, and
had Owen remained another day he would have been able, no doubt, to
bring them back with him into British territory.</p>

<p>As it was this event was only postponed for a short time, for
Captain Thruston, who was sent to reconnoitre the western shores of
the Albert Nyanza in March, found on the 23rd of that month the two
Sudanese companies at Mahaji Soghair; to this spot they had drifted
from Wadelai, not finding enough supplies at the latter place.</p>

<p>They were straightway enlisted by Thruston, and eventually
brought back under the British flag to Uganda.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Events in the Bahr el Ghazal up to
February, 1894.</span>We must now take a glance at the Bahr el
Ghazal, and endeavour to bring the history of that province, for
the present, up to the beginning of 1894.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1886.</span>The state of things in the
Bahr el Ghazal since 1886 had been, on the whole, peaceable. On the
death of Osman Ganu, Dervish commandant of Shakka, <span class=
"sidenote">1888. Abu Mariam.</span>about 1888, the Emir Abu Mariam
had succeeded him, and for three or four years little fighting had
taken place. The country had relapsed into its original barbarous
state of small native independent tribes, and Dervish influence,
although nominally extending over the whole province, did not make
itself felt in the direction of aggression.</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of record occurred until La KÃ©thulle appeared on
the scene from the south. This officer had been ordered by Van
Kerckhoven in <span class="sidenote">1891.</span>1891 to proceed to
Rafaiâs, make friendly treaties with him, and obtain his assistance
in furthering Van Kerckhovenâs expedition. He left Bomokandi in
February, <span class="sidenote">1892.</span>1892, and reached
Rafaiâs early in April. Here he was received in a most friendly
manner, and made a treaty with Rafai on the 7th April. During the
remainder of the year he established Congo posts up to the 7th
parallel of north latitude, such as Alewali and Bandassi. Rafai
assisted him to the best of his ability, and from December, 1892,
to April, <span class="sidenote">1893.</span>1893, accompanied him
on an exploring tour <em>viÃ¢</em> Yangu, Baraka, and the Upper Bali
to Sango and back. La KÃ©thulle then returned to Yakoma, where a
large expedition for the North was being organised by the Belgians,
under Captain Nilis.</p>

<p>During this summer (1893), in consequence of some inter-tribal
fighting, Abu Mariam advanced against the Dinka or JangÃ© tribe.
<span class="sidenote">Dinkas beat Dervishes.</span>A battle took
place, in which Abu Mariam was killed and his force destroyed,
whereupon the fugitive Dervishes took refuge in Shakka, leaving
many of their rifles in the hands of the Dinkas. On hearing of this
the Belgian Governor of Zemio (Le Marinel) sent to Faki Ahmed and
Ajerra, chiefs in Dar Fertit, and unwilling allies of the
Dervishes, asking them to make common cause with the Dinkas against
the Mahdists. At the same time he despatched an ally of Zemioâs,
one BauduÃ©, who appears to have been starting an expedition in the
direction of Deim Bakr âto conquer the Bahr el Ghazalâ on his own
account, to help, and reinforced him by sending 2,000 men to
Mbanga.</p>

<p>They were, however, not required. The Dervishes were too broken
to renew the attack on the Dinkas, and no further action appears to
have taken place in this direction. <span class=
"sidenote">Mahmud.</span>Mahmud, chief Emir of Kordofan and the
Bahr El Ghazal, was much incensed at Abu Mariamâs defeat, and sent
to Darfur for reinforcements; but the chiefs in Darfur refused to
assist, or even to come and see him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1894.</span>By the beginning of 1894 the
Congo Expedition for the North was ready, and in February Nilis,
with La KÃ©thulle as second in command, five other whites (Lannoy,
GÃ©rard, Libois, Gonse Deschrymacker, and Sergeant Philippart) and a
strong party, made a start for the North.</p>

<p>Recapitulating shortly, we see that by the end of February,
1894, the Dervishes based on Rejaf were pressing the remains of the
Kerckhoven expedition under Baert on the Congo-Nile watershed, but
that in the rest of the Bahr el Ghazal their influence was
practically nil, their only post of any importance, and that weakly
held, being Shakka, to the north of the Bahr el Arab. The Congo
forces had not succeeded in establishing posts on the Nile, whilst
between the north-west of the Bahr el Ghazal and Zemioâs country
they were busy cementing relations with the natives, who seemed not
ill-disposed to receive them. Since the British Government had
taken over Uganda on 1st April, 1893, fears had been expressed that
the Dervishes would attack the colony from the north; but for this
there appears to have been no justification, for the Khalifa had no
intention of enlarging his dominions in this direction, and was
content to keep Rejaf as a penal settlement and as an outpost
against the inroads of the whites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span><span class=
"sidenote">La KÃ©thulle.</span>The expedition under La KÃ©thulle (for
Nilisâe name disappears almost at once) penetrated, <em>viÃ¢</em>
Sandu, up the Chinko River, Sango, back to Sandu, Bakuma, Kreich,
Bandassi country (7Â° 30â² north lat.), Upper Adda or Bahr el Arab
(8Â° 40â² north lat.), to the important village of Hofrat el Nahas
(where there are valuable copper mines), being well received all
along the route. At Hofrat el Nahas the natives are said to have
offered<a id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class=
"fnanchor">[195]</a> to take La KÃ©thulle west along the caravan
route to Lake Chad, but he declined, and himself returned along his
own route to Rafai, where he arrived on 8th June, 1894, and at once
proceeded to Europe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Re-occupation by Dervishes.</span>The
Khalifa, on hearing of the presence of Europeans in the Bahr el
Ghazal, and of their having communicated with the Emir of Shakka,
sent orders to Mahmud to re-occupy the Bahr el Ghazal, and in
consequence a force of 1,800 Sudanese riflemen and 2,000 spearmen,
under the Emir Khatim Musa, was despatched from Shakka towards the
Belgian posts in the summer of 1894; they were delayed some time by
the rains, but eventually pushed forward. The Belgians, whose
headquarters were at Liffi, with advanced post at Hofrat el Nahas
(?), retired before Khatim Musa, who entered Faroge. Sheikh Hamed,
finding himself deserted by the Belgians, sided with the Dervishes,
and handed over the treaties; these, together with two letters
written by Belgians at Liffi, dated September, 1894, arrived at
Omdurman in January, 1895.</p>

<p>The result of the Dervish victory over Fadl el Mula manifested
itself at Omdurman in May, 1894, by a steamer from Rejaf bringing
back loot in the shape of many tarbushes, two guns, ivory, five red
standards with white stripes, and many breech-loading rifles and
Congo Free State buttons, together with a report that a great
victory had been gained over the âTurks.â This produced at first
considerable conjecture in Egypt as to the identity of those who
had been defeated.</p>

<p>As regards Abu Girga, he was thrown into prison about the same
time by Dafaalla.</p>

<p>The Dervishes had meanwhile been losing ground in the west, and
only retained garrisons at El Fasher, El Obeid, Nahud, and Shakka,
besides the penal settlement at Rejaf.</p>

<p>During 1894 there were various disturbances and rumours of
invasion by white men in general from the south-west, and by Rabeh
Zubeir in particular. Although little is known about these western
movements in Wadai, etc., it is worth noticing that much
information, curiously accurate on the whole, regarding movements
of Europeans and their native troops on the Upper Nile, trickled
down to Omdurman, and thence to the Egyptian Intelligence
Department.</p>

<p>A rumour reached Omdurman in November, 1894, that Rejaf troops
were being hard pressed (this must refer to the fights of the
âMahdistsâ with the Congolese), and eleven barges full of troops
were sent as reinforcements. Numerous reports now reached Omdurman
that the whites had beaten the Dervishes; this may refer to the
victory by the Congolese at Egaru on the 23rd December, 1894. The
Rejaf garrison was now estimated at 1,500 riflemen and 3,000
spearmen, with two steamers.</p>

<p>In consequence of the Franco-Congolese treaty of 1894, Major
Cunningham and Lieut. Vandeleur were sent from Uganda in the
beginning of 1895 to Dufile, where they planted the British flag on
the 15th January. A hostile reception was given them at Wadelai in
consequence, it is believed, of the alliance of the chief of that
place with Kabarega.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1895.</span>On the retreat of the
Belgians in the Bahr el Ghazal, Khatim Musa retired towards Shakka,
but famine and disease broke out in his camp, and most of his black
Jehadia deserted to Zemio. <span class="sidenote">Re-evacuation by
Dervishes.</span>The latter thereupon marched against Musa, who had
but 800 left out of 4,000, and even these were mostly sick. Khatim
Musa retreated towards Mahmudâs force in Kordofan, Abu Khawata, the
recently-appointed Emir of Shakka, accompanying him. The Bahr el
Ghazal was thus left open to any Europeans who chose to enter
(April 1895).</p>

<p>In June a frantic message arrived at Omdurman from Wad Dafaalla,
clamouring for reinforcements, as he was threatened by the speedy
advance of an European force. He had therefore retired to
Shambe.</p>

<p>This panic would seem to have been a false alarm, consequent
perhaps on Congolese reinforcements having been sent to Dongu.
However, numbers of men were collected and hastily sent upstream
from Omdurman under one Hamadnalla, Emir of the Powder Factory at
Khartoum. Strengthened by these (4,000 in all), Wad Dafaalla
returned to Rejaf, and sent Hamadnalla in the autumn to suppress an
attack by the riverain tribes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1896.</span>During 1896 Dafaalla and his
men appear to have been paralysed by the news of the Dongola
campaign, and remained quiet.</p>

<p>Nothing further of interest occurred, as far as we know, until
the attack and occupation of Rejaf in 1897, by Chaltin.</p>

<p>Chaltinâs columnâpart of a large force of Congo troops under
Baron Dhanisâcomposed of five white officers, four white
non-commissioned officers, 806 trained riflemen, some guns, 250
porters, 50 Azande (Nyam-Nyam) riflemen, and 500 spearmen, under
their chiefs Renzi and Bafuka, arrived at Surur at the end of the
year, and left it on the 1st January. <span class=
"sidenote">1897.</span>On the 14th February they reached the Nile
at BeddÃªn, and their scouts came into touch with the Dervishes.
<span class="sidenote">Capture of Rejaf by Chaltin.</span>On the
17th they attacked the Dervish position near Rejaf, held by about
2,000 men, and routed them with great loss; later in the day they
had another small action, and occupied Rejaf, the Dervishes bolting
to the north. Chaltin lost<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_264">[264]</span> one white officer (Sarolea) killed and a
few men, and the enemy lost nine Emirs,<a id=
"FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class=
"fnanchor">[196]</a> 200 dead, three guns, 700 rifles, and a large
stock of ammunition and provisions. Rejaf was found to possess a
good landing place, and was strengthened by earthworks. Lado no
longer existed.</p>

<p>A report from the Congo (June, 1897) stated that there were then
15,000 (!?) Dervishes at Bor, and that they had three European
prisoners, of whose identity nothing was certain.<a id=
"FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class=
"fnanchor">[197]</a> Chaltin himself had then about 1,300 men with
him, and was mostly at a spot called Loka, on high ground, four
daysâ march south-west of Rejaf. He reported the soil to be poor,
and that there was little prospect of trade. For subsequent events

<hr class="decor width3 spaced2">

<p class="sch">FROM MAY, 1898, TO THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF THE
DERVISH POWER (END OF 1899).</p>

<p>After the battle of the Atbara (8th April, 1898), the Khalifa
concentrated his forces at Omdurman, and began making every
preparation for resistance. The chief outlying force of Dervishes
was one of between 5,000 and 6,000 men at and round Gedaref, under
Ahmed Fedil, and these, after moving towards Mahmud, had returned
to Gedaref. In addition to these, there were small Dervish
garrisons at places up the river; at Bor (Upper White Nile, 1,200);
and in Kordofan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Anglo-Egyptian preparations went on steadily, and
by the 24th August the following troops were moving along the
western bank of the 6th Cataract:â</p>

<p>British Troops (under Major-General Gatacre):â</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>21st Lancers.</li>

<li>32nd Field and 37th Howitzer Batteries, R.A.</li>

<li>1st Brigade (1st Warwicks, Lincolns, Camerons and Seaforths,
with 6 Maxims, and a detachment R.E.)âWauchope.</li>

<li>2nd Brigade (1st Grenadier Guards and Northumberland Fusiliers,
2nd Lancashire Fusiliers and Rifle Brigade, with 4 Maxims, and a
detachment R.E.)âLyttelton.</li>
</ul>

<p>Egyptian Troops (Major-General Hunter):â</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>9 Squadrons Cavalry.</li>

<li>1 Horse and 4 Field Batteries.</li>

<li>8 Companies Camel Corps.</li>

<li>10 Maxims.</li>

<li>1st Brigade (2nd, IX, X and XI)âMacdonald.</li>

<li>2nd Brigade (8th, XII, XIII and XIV)âMaxwell.</li>

<li>3rd Brigade (3rd, 4th, 7th and 15th)âLewis.</li>

<li>4th Brigade (1st, 5th, 17th, and 18th)âCollinson.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides Camel Transport, Medical Corps, O.S.C., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pad2">Grand Total, about 23,000 men.</p>

<p>The river force consisted of a flotilla of 10 armoured gunboats,
including two 40-pounder guns, besides other steamers, boats and
barges.</p>

<p>No resistance was encountered up to Kereri.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle of Omdurman.</span>On the 2nd
September the army, in zeriba at Egeiga, 8 miles from Omdurman, was
attacked by the Khalifa in force, but repulsed him with heavy
slaughter. The Anglo-Egyptian Army then proceeded towards Omdurman,
but was fiercely attacked again, twice on the right rear
(Macdonaldâs brigade). By our troops wheeling to the right, this
final attack was completely repulsed, chiefly through the
steadiness of the 1st Egyptian Brigade, and the army continued its
march, capturing Omdurman with little or no resistance. The Khalifa
fled a few minutes before the Sirdar entered his house. The
Anglo-Egyptian loss was as follows:â</p>

<p>The dead bodies of 10,560 Dervishes were counted on the
battlefield.</p>

<p>The result of the battle was the practical annihilation of the
Khalifaâs armyâestimated at over 40,000 menâthe consequent
extinction of Mahdism in the Sudan, and the submission of nearly
the whole country formerly under Egyptian authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>The British
troops were now quickly sent down-stream, and the Sirdarâshortly
afterwards elevated to the Peerage under the name of Lord Kitchener
of Khartoumâturned his attention to stamping out the remaining
Dervishes, to reducing the country to some sort of order, and to
exploring up-stream, with a view of meeting the French expedition
under Major Marchand, which had been reported as having arrived at
Kodok.</p>

<p class="cp1">THE MAHDIâS TOMB, MORNING AFTER THE BATTLE OF 2ND
SEPTEMBER, 1898.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kodok.</span>On the 10th September the
Sirdar left Omdurman for the south with 5 gunboats, 2 Sudanese
Battalions (XI and XIII), 100 Camerons, an Egyptian battery, etc.,
and having destroyed a Dervish force of 700 at Renk on the 15th,
found, on the 19th, the French expedition entrenched at Kodok. This
gallant little force of about 180 men had, after experiencing
enormous difficulties in the swampy region of the Bahr el Ghazal,
penetrated, with the help of its steam-launch, the âFaidherbe,â the
country between the Nile-Congo watershed and Kodok, and had arrived
at this latter point on the 10th July. On the 25th August they had
been attacked by a Dervish force in 2 steamers, but had repulsed
them, and were awaiting a second attack, when the Egyptian gunboats
arrived and probably saved them from annihilation.<a id=
"FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class=
"fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The British and Egyptian flags were at once hoisted to the south
of the French flag at Kodok, and the XIth Battalion, a gunboat and
4 guns were left at this point under Major Jackson. After much
negotiation between France and England, which threatened at one
time to lead to serious results between the two Powers, the French
position was found to be untenable, and Kodok was eventually
evacuated on the 11th December by Marchand and his companions, the
latter proceeding to Jibuti, <em>viÃ¢</em> the Sobat and Abyssinia,
and eventually reached France in May 1899.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sobat.</span>The junction of the Sobat
and Nile was reached on the 20th September, and a garrison (the
XIIIth Battalion) left here under Captain Gamble. The Bahr el Jebel
was found entirely closed by sudd, but a gunboat under Major Peake
was sent up the Bahr el Ghazal, and hoisted the Egyptian flag a few
miles north of <span class="sidenote">Meshra el Rek.</span>Meshra
el Rek. Subsequently the Bahr el Zeraf was explored by Major
Stanton for a distance of 175 miles, and the Sobat was explored by
Majors Gamble, Maxse, Capper, etc., up to the 282nd mile, both
these rivers and their tributaries being mapped and their courses
laid down provisionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Blue Nile.</span>Immediately after the occupation of
Omdurman gunboats were sent to patrol the Blue Nile, and a force of
600 men (Xth Battalion) and the R.I.F. Maxim detachment was
despatched under Major-General Hunter, on the 19th September, to
occupy Sennar, Karkoj, and Roseires, which was done on the 23rd
September, 1st October, and 30th September respectively.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle of Gedaref. (22.9.98).</span>On
the 22nd September, Colonel Parsons, who had left Kassala on the
7th, and crossed the Atbara in flood with a force<a id=
"FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class=
"fnanchor">[199]</a> of about 1,400 men, to occupy Gedaref, came
into collision with its garrison of about 3,200 men, a few miles
north of the town, and, beating off two desperate attacks, with a
loss of 53 killed and 61 wounded out of 1,347, advanced and
occupied the place.</p>

<p>Ahmed Fedil himself, who with about half the original garrison
had previously left Gedaref in response to a summons from the
Khalifa to reinforce him against the main advance on Omdurman,
encountered General Hunter and the gunboats on the Blue Nile near
Rufaa, and realising that Omdurman must have fallen, resolved to
return at once and retake his headquarters at Gedaref, where he
arrived at dawn on 28th September with some 4,000 to 5,000 men.</p>

<p class="cp1">THE LATE EMIR AHMED FEDIL.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>After two determined efforts to dislodge the Anglo-Egyptian
troops, now safely ensconced in several walled enclosures, he
withdrew after heavy loss to the village of Sofi on the Abu Haraz
road, barely two miles from our forts. Here he remained for three
days quietly collecting cattle and grain from the outskirts of the
town and then moved to Asar, 10 miles south of Gedaref.</p>

<p>On receipt of the news at Omdurman of the state of affairs at
Gedaref, Lieut.-Colonel Collinson was despatched to Abu Haraz with
a force of about 1,100 Camel Corps and Sudanese Infantry with 2
Maxims, and arrived at Gedaref on the 21st October. Two days after
the arrival of these reinforcements Ahmed Fedil began his move
westwards <em>viÃ¢</em> Beila and Hawata to Roseires, his march
being dogged by friendlies under command of the recently
surrendered Emir Abu Bakr Mustafa.</p>

<p>Efforts were then directed, through gunboats on the Blue Nile,
to prevent him crossing that river with a view to joining the
Khalifa, at that time near Sherkeila.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Action near Roseires
(26.12.98).</span>These were eventually successful, for Colonel
Lewis, hearing from Roseires that the enemy were about to make the
attempt to cross close by, marched with a small column (Xth
Battalion and Friendlies), on the night of Christmas day, and in
spite of the troops suffering much from fever, they, in a severe
action on the following day, cut up most<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_268">[268]</span> of Fedilâs force as they were crossing the
river near Dakhila, the leader and a few hundred men only escaping.
About 500 Dervishes were killed,<a id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> whilst 1 British officer
was wounded and 24 Egyptian Sudanese were killed and 118 wounded.
Most of the remaining Dervishes subsequently surrendered on the
White Nile.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Occupation of Gallabat.</span>As the
Abyssinians were becoming alarmed in consequence of our advance,
and threatened trouble on their north-west frontier, a small body
of troops was despatched from Gedaref to Gallabat, under
Lieut.-Colonel Collinson, and hoisted the British and Egyptian
flags alongside the Abyssinian one already flying on the old fort
there (7th December).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Occupation of Fazogli.</span>Fazogli and
Famaka were also occupied by a small force under Lieut.-Colonel
Nason, on the 22nd January, and friendly overtures were made to the
Abyssinians in the neighbourhood, with completely successful
results.</p>

<p>On 19th January, 1899, an agreement was signed between Great
Britain and Egypt, defining the status of the Sudan, and laying
down broad principles for its government (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_283">p. 283</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Reconnaissance to
Sherkeila.</span>Meanwhile, it having been determined to dislodge
the Khalifa if possible from his position near Sherkeila, Col. W.
Kitchener started with a force of 2,007 regulars<a id=
"FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class=
"fnanchor">[201]</a> and 1,650 irregulars from Fachi Shoya on the
25th January for that place. On reaching the neighbourhood of
Sherkeila, 30th January, 1899, the Dervish force was found to be
occupying a strong position, and was estimated at over 6,000 men.
After consideration, no attack was made, and the force returned to
the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Movements of Khalifa.</span>During
February reports were received that the Khalifa intended to attack
Omdurman, but he made no forward movement, and remained in the
neighbourhood of Sherkeila for some months. Many of his men
deserted him owing to scarcity of food, and the neighbouring tribes
harried him considerably.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Patrols.</span>Several further
river-patrols were undertaken during the spring towards the Bahr el
Jebel, but the sudd still prevented progress up that river. Another
patrol pushed up to the farthest navigable limit of the Baro.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1899. Operations against
Khalifa.</span>The Khalifa remained at Sherkeila till the beginning
of May, when, finding himself short of food, he moved south, with
about 3,000 men, in the direction of Jebel Gedir. During July and
August he remained near Jebel Gurun, raiding for food in various
directions, and being harassed by the Gowama and other Arab tribes.
He reached Jebel Gerada, 6 miles north of Jebel Gedir, towards the
end of August, and preparations were made in September for an
expedition to capture or dislodge him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kaka expedition.</span>Based on Kaka, the
advanced guard of the force of 8,000 men reached Fungor, 50 miles
inland, but the Khalifa had escaped north on the 16th October, and
gave out his intention of marching on Omdurman, <em>viÃ¢</em> Dueim.
A flying column in gunboats under Colonel Lewis was quickly
organised to follow and head him off from the river; but the enemy
did not proceed much farther north than opposite Goz Abu Guma.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gedid expedition.</span>By the middle of
November orders were given for an expedition to attack the Khalifa
in the direction of Gedid, and a flying column<a id=
"FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class=
"fnanchor">[202]</a> of 3,700 men, under Colonel Sir R. Wingate,
left Fachi Shoya on the 21st November.</p>

<p>On the 22nd contact was established with Ahmed Fedilâs force at
Abu Aadel. The column attacked and seized his camp, inflicting an
estimated loss of over 400 in killed alone, and capturing all the
grain which he was bringing to the Khalifa.</p>

<p>A night march followed to Gedid, and this place, containing
water, was reached at 10 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> on the 23rd.
The Khalifaâs position was located at Um Debreikat, 7 miles to the
south-east, and another midnight march brought the column to within
two miles of his camp. <span class="sidenote">Battle of Um

camp, killing large numbers of them, including the Khalifa, Ali Wad

the day lost, had calmly seated themselves on their sheep-skins and
awaited death. 3,000 prisoners, besides 6,000 women and children,
were taken, and the Dervish loss by death was estimated at another
600.</p>

<p>The total loss of the Egyptian Column was 4 killed and 29

<h3>EXPEDITIONS FROM UGANDA.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Lieut.-Colonels Macdonald and Martyr, having quelled
the mutiny of Sudanese troops in Uganda, pushed forward from that
region in two small columns during the summer and autumn of 1898.
Macdonald, starting from Mount Elgon, and marching across country,
reached Latuka in September, and having made friends with the
chiefs in this district, returned to Uganda in November. Martyr,
proceeding down the Nile, reached Bedden and Rejaf in November,
and, assisted by the Congo Free State troops, pushed on to Bor,
where a Dervish garrison had been posted since March, 1897. On
hearing of the advance of white troops, the Dervishes under Arabi
Wad Dafaalla fled in a north-west direction. Martyr, hearing that
the sudd extended from Shambe to Lake No, and recognising that no
gunboat from down stream could join hands with him for many months
to come, whilst the country around had been desolated by the enemy,
retired again to Bedden, and formed posts at Fort Berkeley, Afuddo,
and Wadelai (spring of 1899).</p>

<h3>ANGLO-FRENCH AGREEMENT.<a id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></h3>

<p>The Marchand column had, on its way to Kodok, proceeded down the
Sueh river to Meshra el Rek, and had left small posts along its
route at Tembura and many other places, even in the Rumbek
country.<a id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class=
"fnanchor">[204]</a> After the evacuation of Kodok, however,
negotiations were entered into by the British and French
Governments, and in consequence of an Agreement dated 21st March,
1899, all French territorial claim to the Bahr el Ghazal was
relinquished, and the line separating the spheres of influence was
drawn northwards along the Congo-Nile watershed, thence between the
territories of Darfur and Wadai, and thence in a north-west
direction up to the frontier of Tripoli.</p>

<h3>AFFAIRS IN ABYSSINIA.</h3>

<p>Reference must here be made to affairs in Abyssinia, which have
some bearing on Sudan matters.</p>

<p>After the Abyssinian victory over the Italians at Adua (1st
March, 1896), the importance of the country began to attract much
attention in Europe. Missions were sent from France and Russia to
enter into friendly relations with the new Power, and in 1897, a
British Mission under Mr. Rodd was despatched for the same purpose.
A friendly treaty was concluded on the 14th May, but little
progress in the way of commerce was made for some time. The French,
whose merchants had been for many years established at the capital,
Addis Abbaba, fitted out an expedition under Captain Clochette
(late Marine Artillery) in the spring of 1897, which proceeded in
the direction of the White Nile. Clochette died, and De Bonchamps,
who succeeded him in the command, after many difficulties reached
the Baro river, and eventually marched down it to the Sobat. It is
difficult to say how far he penetrated, but the want of a boat and
of supplies, the vast marshes, fever, and desertions of his
followers, formed together such insurmountable obstacles that he
was, after a gallant struggle, obliged to turn back (31st December,
1897) without reaching the Nile.</p>

<p>During 1897 an Abyssinian expedition was organised under Ras
Makunnen, of Harrar, to subdue a rising in Beni Shangul. Without
coming to a pitched battle, Wad Tur el Guri was defeated in detail,
and most of this country was occupied in the spring of 1898.</p>

<p>In the early summer of 1898 another Abyssinian Expedition came
down from the hills towards the Sobat and Nile. It was composed of
3,000 to 4,000 men, mostly armed with rifles, under Dejaj Tesemma.
About half the men were mounted, and it is believed that some guns
accompanied them. With the expedition were three EuropeansâM.
Faivre (French), Col. Artomonoff (Russian), and M. Potter
(Swissâsubsequently killed).</p>

<p>Part of this force arrived at Waratong, on the Pibor, about
June, and pushed on to the White Nile, <em>viÃ¢</em> Nasser, and the
left bank of the Sobat. It arrived at Sobat mouth at the end of
June, only a few days before Marchand and his companions passed
that point in their boats. Owing, it is reported, to the death of
Tesemma,<a id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class=
"fnanchor">[205]</a> the expedition returned almost immediately,
apparently by the same way it had come, to the south of Waratong
and the Kum Kum (or Kung Kung) country.</p>

<p>The victory of Omdurman and our subsequent successes appear to
have impressed the Abyssinians, and a revolt by Mangasha, of Tigre,
coupled perhaps with some uneasiness as to his possessions in the
north-west of his kingdom, induced the Emperor Menelik to lead a
large army into Tigre in the late autumn of 1898.</p>

<p>Mangasha was, however, quickly suppressed; the relations of the
NegÃ»s with England and Egypt continued to be of the most friendly
character, and these were further accentuated by the news of the
death of the Khalifa in November, 1899.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>THE FRENCH
ADVANCE INTO THE BAHR EL GHAZAL, <span class="sc">etc.</span></h3>

<p class="center">(Taken from French sources.)<a id=

"fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>âWhen the Franco-Congolese agreement of 14th July, 1894, was
concluded, the French had little difficulty in taking over the
territory that had been occupied by the Belgians. Three companies
of Senegalese <em>tirailleurs</em>âin effective force 175 men
eachâformed the regular military forces, and to these were joined,
after a while, the native militia that had been recruited by the
Belgians. Captains Vermot, Ditte, and Hossinger successively
proceeded to take possession of the fortified posts still in the
hands of the agents of the Congo State, and it was thus that M.
Liotard was able, on his return to the Congo, at the beginning of
1895, after a seven monthsâ absence in France, to occupy as
Commissioner of the Republic, and Lieutenant-Governor of Upper
Ubangi, the important centre Zemio, on the 10th July, situated at
248 miles from the confluence of the MâBomu with the Welle.
Consequently, he was able to control the NâSakarras and Azande
tribes, whose chiefs, Bangassu, RafaÃ¯, and Zemio, are now faithful
allies of France.</p>

<p>âOnce these territories were placed under direct French control,
M. Liotard proceeded to carry out the initial programme of
penetrating towards the Nile, and began to push forward the
occupation of the Bahr El Ghazal Province, the rights over which,
acquired by their treaty with England of 12th May, 1894, had been
ceded to France by the Belgian Congolese.</p>

<p>âIn February, 1896, M. Liotard, accompanied by Captain
Hossinger, arrived at Tembura, where he was warmly received by the
Azande Sultan. A post was established, and Captain Hossinger put in
command. He was assassinated some months afterwards, 6th July, by a
Senegalee belonging to the garrison. This did not modify in the
least the political situation. M. Liotard had gained such an
ascendency over the natives, that French authority was as firmly
established as if it had been preceded by a vigorous military
campaign.</p>

<p>âMoreover the personal influence of the Lieutenant-Governor
impressed itself equally on his white fellow-workers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">In the Bahr El Ghazal ProvinceâMarchand
Mission.</span>âIt was thus that at the beginning of 1896, French
political action had penetrated beyond the ridge of the Congo
Basin, and had made itself felt in the Bahr El Ghazal Province,
that is, in the Basin of the Nile. Captain Marchand therefore had
had nothing to do with this, as it was only on the 25th June, 1896,
practically four months after the occupation of Tembura, that this
officer embarked at Marseilles. With him were Captains Baratier,
Germain, Mangin, Lieutenant Largeau, Naval-Lieutenant Morin,
Midshipman DyÃ©, Landerouin, interpreter Dr. Emily, 12 French
non-commissioned officers, and 150 Senegalese <em>tirailleurs</em>.
He had at his disposition two small steamers, the âFaidherbeâ and
the âDuc dâUzÃ©s,â and three barges made of aluminium, the
âPleigneur,â âCrampel,â and the âLauziÃ¨re.â</p>

<p>âOn the 23rd July, 1896, Marchand disembarked at Loango, and set
to work to send forward the members of his staff and his material.
The task was difficult, as the tribes between Loango and
Brazzaville were in rebellion.</p>

<p>âOn the 27th September, the head of the Mission arrived at
Loudima, 155 miles from Brazzaville, in a dying condition. However,
he pulled through, and on the 19th October he was on his feet
again. The country had been pacified, and transports were able to
get through, so that by the 1st March, 1897, Captain Marchand was
able to leave Brazzaville and to reach the Upper Ubangi.</p>

<p>âEverything here was prepared for his forward march. M. Liotard
having opened up on the east the road from Zemio to Tembura, had
also freed the road to the north. To effect this, he had taken
possession of Deim Zubeir, in June, 1897, formerly the residence of
Lupton Bey when he commanded the Bahr El Ghazal. Thus Captain
Marchand had the choice of two roads for reaching the Nileâthe way
by ZemioâTembura, with the River Sueh for his flotilla, or the way
of ZemioâDeim Zubeir, with the Bahr El Homr. Captain Marchand chose
the first, and by tremendous exertions, lasting over eight months,
all the material (boats, stores and ammunition) was concentrated
near Tembura, in Fort Hossinger on the banks of the Sueh. This was
in the last days of 1897.</p>

<p>âMarchand then chose Kojali as his point of embarkation. It is
situated on the Sueh (about 50 miles N.N.E. from Fort Hossinger),
and he connected it with MÃ©rÃ©<a id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> by a road over 16 feet
wide and 99 miles in lengthâa gigantic work. He built a dockyard at
Kojali, with slips, for repairing his boats; then, 4 miles above
the confluence of the Wau and the Sueh, he built Fort Desaix,<a id=
"FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class=
"fnanchor">[208]</a> near the old Kuchuk Ali, and, in order to
connect this with Kojali, he established the âRapidesâ station
(Rafili), latitude N. 6Â° 52â³.</p>

<p>âIn the month of November, 1897, the whole mission was
established on this solid base of operations, with the two gunboats
âFaidherbeâ and âNil,â and ten barges built of steel and
aluminium.</p>

<p>âMarchand, from his headquarters, Fort Desaix, set himself to
convert the pronounced hostility of the Dinkas<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_272">[272]</span> (estimated at 5,000,000 (?)) into a more
amicable attitude, by making them understand that he had not come
to raid them in the name of the Sultan Tembura.</p>

<p>âIn February, 1898, the announcement that a party of whites
coming from the south had arrived at Ayak, on the Naam or Rohl
River, determined Marchand to put his troops in motion, and this
had an excellent moral effect on the population. Lieutenant Gouly
was sent to occupy MâBia, two daysâ march from Ayak and Rumbek, but
he unhappily died there of an attack of bilious hematuric fever;
Captain Germain marched from the âRapidesâ post towards the Tonj,
where the post of observation DiabÃ©rÃ© was established; Captain
Mangin went from Fort Desaix to Jur Ghattas; while a reinforcement
of 100 <em>tirailleurs</em>, armed with âGrasâ carbines, arrived at
Fort Desaix from Deim Zubeir. All the native chiefs then sent to
Fort Desaix with offers of help.</p>

<p>âOn the 26th March, Captain Baratier and the interpreter
Landerouin returned from a reconnaissance which they had made as
far as the confluence of the Bahr El Arab and up to Lake NÃ´, while
Captain Largeau had explored the Bahr El Homr and made a survey of
the course of the River Wau.</p>

<p>âAt this time Captain Marchand occupied the following centres in
the Basin of the Bahr El Ghazal:âTembura, Kojali, les Rapides, Fort
Desaix, Meshra El Rek, Bahr El Arab, Rumbek, Jur Ghattas, MâBia,
and Ayak. It was then that he wrote:â</p>

<p>ââI hold now, in the Basin of the Bahr El Ghazalâthat is, of the
Nileâan all-powerful position. I have seven barges or steel boats,
a steamer under way, fifteen canoes made by my
<em>tirailleurs</em>, able to take me wherever I wish in the Basin
of the Nile, where the first French steamer has now penetrated in
spite of obstacles and every hostility.</p>

<p>ââBut do not think that our position is altogether an agreeable
one. First of all, we are dying of hunger, and for a long time we
have depended almost exclusively on what we shoot for food. You
know that starvation was the cause of the disaster in this
neighbourhood to the Dhanis<a id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> expedition. Locusts have
ravaged the few plantations of the Bongo natives on which we were
depending, and my own plantations are also destroyed. How are we
going to reach the Nile? Shall we be forced to eat the
<em>ambach</em> of the marshes? And then, if it were only the
question of pushing quickly through with my boats, it would be
little. But the problem is much more difficult. One must not pass
through here only. The march through a country does not constitute
a right to the country traversed. It must be an <em>effective</em>
occupation, etc.â</p>

<p>âIn spite of all these obstacles, Marchand and his companions
arrived at Kodok on the 10th July, not without having had to do
with the Dervishes. Three different times were they attacked by
them in large numbers, but the rifles of the Senegalese
<em>tirailleurs</em> soon caused great havoc in their ranks, and
they fled, leaving their dead behind them. Thus the French Mission
was able to establish itself at Kodok.â</p>

<hr class="decor width2 spaced2">

<p class="sch">FROM 1900 ONWARDS.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1900.</span>The new year opened
auspiciously by the capture of Osman Digna on the 18th January by
Captain F. Burges, Mamur Mohammed Bey, and a police patrol, in the
Warriba Hills, some 90 miles south-west of Suakin. This notorious
Emir was sent to Rosetta to join the other Dervish prisoners, and
is now (1904) at Damietta.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sudd and Survey expeditions.</span>All
the rivers were exceptionally low during the winter of 1899-1900,
and the various expeditions and survey parties which were now
started off had much difficulty in getting through to their
posts.</p>

<p>Major Peake commenced clearing the sudd on the last day of
December, and succeeded in opening a channel in the following April
(<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_304">p. 304</a>). Sir W. Garstin also
came up to study the Bahr el Jebel and Bahr el Ghazal rivers.</p>

<p>At the end of February parties of English (Uganda) (under
Captain Gage), French (under Lieutenant Tanquedec), and Congolese
(under Commandant Henry) troops arrived at Omdurman, having been
found by Major Peake trying to cut their way through Block 3. The
Uganda and Congolese parties were sent back, and the French (who
were evacuating the Bahr el Ghazal) continued their journey to
Europe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abyssinian Frontier.</span>With the
object of coming to an arrangement with Abyssinia regarding the
frontier between that country and the Sudan, two surveying
expeditions were sent out towards the end of 1899, under Major
Austin, D.S.O., and Lieutenant Gwynn, D.S.O., respectively. The
former, with Lieutenant Bright, surveyed up the Sobat and Baro
Rivers to Gore, and thence in a southerly direction to the Gelo,
returning <em>viÃ¢</em> the Pibor River to Nasser. Owing to
obstruction on the part of local Abyssinian chiefs Major Austin was
unable to penetrate to Lake Rudolf, but the geographical results of
his expedition were most useful. Lieutenants Gwynn and Jackson
started up the Blue Nile to Famaka, thence south along the edge of
the Abyssinian plateau, and across the Sonka to the Garre river,
whence they returned <em>viÃ¢</em> Nasser, after doing much valuable
survey work.</p>

<p>On 22nd December, 1899, Sir R. Wingate was appointed Sirdar and
Governor-General, vice Lord Kitchener, called to South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Millenniumists.</span>In January, 1900,
an increasing sect in Omdurman, which was dubbed âthe
Millenniumists,â and might have led to trouble, was suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rabeh Zubeir.</span>In April Rabeh Zubeir
was attacked near Lake Chad by three converging French columns; he
himself was killed, and his kingdom absolutely destroyed.</p>

<p>The rest of the year was mostly occupied in the Government
settling down to its work, organising the exhausted country, etc.;
no events of any importance took place till the end of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kiro.</span>A Sudanese post was
established in November at Kiro, on the left bank of the Upper
Nile, a few miles north of the Belgian post, about 5Â° 30â² north
lat. This post, finding in April, 1901, that it was just south of
5Â° 30â², crossed the river to Mongalla, where it established itself
permanently.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Occupation of Bahr el Ghazal.</span>On
November 29th, 1900, an expedition under Lieut.-Colonel Sparkes
left Omdurman in steamers in order to occupy the Bahr el Ghazal. It
consisted of five British and 13 native officers, 82 regulars, and
266 irregulars, with necessary stores, transport, etc.</p>

<p>The party arrived at Meshra el Rek on 14th December, 1900, and
patrols were sent out to reconnoitre. <span class=
"sidenote">1901.</span>Tonj was quickly fixed on as temporary
headquarters (1st January, 1901), and small expeditions were made
by Colonel Sparkes to Wau, Fort Desaix, Rumbek, Amadi, Kiro,
Shambe, and back to Tonj, whilst the remainder of the party
consolidated its position and made friends with the natives.
Lieutenant Fell, R.N., started cutting the sudd in the Jur river,
with the object of opening up a waterway from the Bahr el Ghazal
river, but his arduous labours, lasting for the next 15 months,
were not crowned with success till June, 1902. Major W. Boulnois
meanwhile conducted a patrol to Deim Zubeir, Telgona, Faroge
(Forga), and Chamamui, meeting with a most friendly reception from
the chiefs of these districts, and returned to Tonj on 10th April.
Shortly afterwards the same officer proceded to Rumbek and
chastised some raiding Nuers, with the effect of bringing the Agars
and other Dinkas in at once to acknowledge Government
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Colonel Sparkes
now made an extensive patrol to the south, to visit Sultan Tembura
of the Nyam Nyams. Here, after many difficulties of travel, he
arrived on 25th June, 1901, and was most cordially received by the
Sultan, whose people were of a comparatively highly civilised
order. Sparkes returned to Wau on the 27th July, and proceeded
north shortly afterwards, suffering severely from fever. In
November, as Major Boulnois, besides many of the troops, was
invalided owing to the same cause, Major Hunter assumed command of
the Occupation Force.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Frontiers.</span>In the spring of 1901
the question of the Sudan-Eritrea and Abyssinian Frontiers claimed
the attention of the Sudan Government. Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot
concluded, with Lieutenant Colli, at Kassala, on 16th April, a
treaty<a id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class=
"fnanchor">[210]</a> regarding the frontier between Sabderat, the
Atbara, Tomat, and Todluk, and a new grazing convention was also
concluded between Colonel Collinson (Mudir of Kassala) and Signor
Martini (Governor-General of Eritrea) on 28th February, 1901. Major
Gwynn, D.S.O., with Captain Smyth, V.C., continued his surveys from
Famaka northwards (he having arrived at this place from Addis
Abbaba on the 14th April), and fixed a series of important points
during his journeys, which extended altogether from Jebel Jerok to
Gallabat.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Major Austinâs
expedition.</span>Meanwhile Major Austin and Lieutenant Bright had
started from Nasser on a further expedition south-eastwards from
Nasser on the 12th January. They were to find stores provided by
the Abyssinians at Murle, on the north bank of Lake Rudolf, but on
arriving at this point, after making a valuable survey from Nasser,
they found no signs of Abyssinians or stores. They then struck
south along the western shore of the lake, and after suffering
severely from hunger and sickness, and losing 39 out of 53 of their
men by starvation, they eventually arrived at Lake Baringo on the
6th August.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Darfur.</span>Since 1898 Ali Dinar had
been with some difficulty establishing himself on the throne of
Darfur. He was appointed Government-Agent in that country, and in
June, 1901, he began paying an annual tribute.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Raids in Darfur.</span>In September Ali
Dinar sent a strong force under Tirab Suleiman against the Maalia
and Rizeigat Arabs in the south, whom he wished to bring under his
sway. Tirab raided them heavily, and on their taking refuge in
Kordofan threatened to pursue them thither. The consequent
consternation in Kordofan was only allayed by the Mudir mobilising
a force of camel corps, etc., near the frontier at Foga and Nahud.
Matters quieted down, and Ali Dinar expressed his apologies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wadai.<a id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>To turn to affairs
in Wadai:â</p>

<p>At the end of 1898 Sultan Yusef died and nominated his second
son Ibrahim to succeed him, whilst Abdel Aziz his eldest son, who
was a violent and war-like character, was blinded to preclude the
possibility of disturbance. As Dud Murra the youngest of the three
brothers got on well with Ibrahim he was left unmolested, and the
late Sultan Yusefâs body was duly interred at Wara, the recognised
burial place of Wadai Sultans. Ibrahim, on his accession, though
his father Yusef was a strong Senussiist, refused to give up
merissa drinking and declared himself an anti-Senussiist. It was at
Sultan Yusefâs request that Senussi had sent Mohammed El Sunni as
his representative at the Court of Abesher at the end of 1897.</p>

<p>Owing to widespread animosity against Ibrahim, caused partly by
this friction with the Senussiists and partly by his execution of
several of the Agids<a id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> he determined to leave
Abesher on the pretext of going on pilgrimage to Wara, but in
reality to seek refuge in the mountains of Abu Sinun. Sheraf El Din
now took charge of affairs with the tacit consent of Jerma Othman
the chief Agid, and sent an expedition to bring back the fugitive
Ibrahim alive or dead. He was eventually betrayed by the ex-dervish
Emir Zogal<a id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class=
"fnanchor">[213]</a> and brought to Abesher, where after being, it
is reported, blinded, he died of his wounds and was buried (1900).
âBetter,â he said, âto die as a Sultan in my Palace than to flee
shamefully before slaves.â (The party sent to capture Ibrahim was
under the command of the slave Gorani Gelma.) In 1902 his remains
were transferred to Wara.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ahmed Abu Ghazali (so-called on account of his long
neck), the son of the former Sultan Ali, was proclaimed Sultan
through the influence of Sheraf El Din, who continued to have the
chief hand in the government. This direction of affairs by a eunuch
was, however, extremely unpopular and, as a protest, in September,
1901, Sultan Bekhit of Dar Sula refused to comply with orders from
Abesher. Jerma, too, endeavoured to install Asil as Sultan in place
of Ahmed Ghazali, but as the latter threatened to have Asilâs eyes
put out, he fled to Fitri and surrendered near there to
Lieut.-Colonel Destenave, in the French sphere. Ahmed now became
annoyed with Jerma, as he considered him responsible for the flight
of Asil, whilst the people, on the other hand, by whom Jerma was
much liked, demanded the head of Ghazaliâs chief adviser, Sheraf El
Din. The Senussi agent, however, Mohammed El Sunni, now stepped in
and effected a reconciliation between Jerma and Sheraf El Din, but
the Sultan deeply incensed at the conduct of Jerma determined to
kill him. Mohammed Sunni, hereupon, again intervened at the
critical moment and obtained his reprieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>With Jerma free
again the Sultan and Sheraf El Din considered they were no longer
safe at Abesher and both resolved to seek refuge in Dar Salamat. On
the flight of the Sultan, Jerma at once assumed the direction of
affairs at the capital and unsuccessfully attacked the fugitive
Sultanâs rearguard soon after it had quitted Abesher. The pursuit
was continued and a severe engagement took place about 40 miles
further south. Another action was subsequently fought in Dar
Salamat in November, 1901, and Ghazali continued his flight to El
Batha.</p>

<p>Jerma now returned to Abeshe and in December 1901 proclaimed Dud
Murra, a youth of barely 20 years of age and brother of Sultan
Ibrahim, as Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mohammed El Sunni.</span>Mohammed El
Sunni, the Senussi agent, is reported (1903) to be dead, and since
the death of the Senussi, in May, 1902, the prestige of that
doctrine is said to have materially decreased in Wadai.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rome Conference.</span>In November, in
consequence of difficulties in the frontier negotiations between
the Sudan, Eritrea and Abyssinia, a Conference was held in Rome,
which resulted in agreements satisfactory to all, and included
customs, postal and telegraph conventions between the Sudan and
Eritrea (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_292">pp. 292-295</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Recapitulation to the end of
1901.</span>Meanwhile the Sudan Government had been settling
itself, exploring its vast territories, organising and
administering the country, instituting legislation, extending
communications, and in general laying the foundations of good
government. Various small disturbances, not necessary to chronicle
in detail, had occurred, chiefly in the neighbourhood of the
frontiers, slave-raiding or refusal of sections of tribes to pay
tribute being the chief causes; but on the whole, in spite of
deficiency of population, limited numbers of officials, and rigid
but necessary economy, the Sudan settled down into an era of peace
and growing prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1902. Bahr el Ghazal.</span>In January,
1902, Captain A. M. Pirie occupied Deim Zubeir and Chamamui, and
was then recalled, owing to the murder of Lieutenant Scott-Barbour
by the Agar Dinkas. This officer had been in charge of a camel
convoy between Shambe and Rumbek, and was treacherously
assassinated on the banks of the Naam river (Rohl) on 10th January.
A punitive expedition was quickly organised by Major Hunter, and in
a series of rapid marches it killed many of the Agars, burned their
villages and captured their cattle. A further expedition under
Captain L. Stack, arriving <em>viÃ¢</em> Shambe from Khartoum in
March, completed the punishment. Myang Matyang, the chief offender,
died in July of wounds received, and the Agars came in and sued for
peace, which was granted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ali Dinar.</span>In January Ali Dinar was
seriously ill, and was at one time reported to be dead; but he
recovered completely.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nuer expedition.</span>A small exploring
expedition sent under Major Blewitt up the Khor Filus into the Nuer
country, belonging to Denkur, in April only resulted in the Nuers
first defying the troops, and then fleeing further into the
interior.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sudd.</span>Meanwhile Major G. E.
Matthews had been hard at work for five months on the 15th block of
sudd, but, owing to there being no current to take away the cut
blocks, it was practically a hopeless task, and was temporarily
given up, the âfalse channelâ which circumvented this portion of
the sudd proving sufficient for purposes of navigation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Surveys.</span>During the spring Major
Gwynn continued his surveys along the Sudan-Eritrea frontier,
fixing points up to Ras Kasar on the Red Sea, and eventually
finishing up at a point 100 miles north of Suakin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Treaty with Menelek.</span>On the 15th
May a treaty was signed at Addis Abbaba, defining the
Sudan-Abyssinian frontier line, and containing other important
clauses (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_296">p. 296</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Western Sudan.</span>The great religious
Sheikh El Senussi, who had previously been residing at the oasis of
Kufra, becoming uneasy at the advance of the French in the Lake
Chad region, as well as being apprehensive of the possible
eventualities that might follow the victory of Omdurman, moved his
headquarters to Geru,<a id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> about 10 days north of
Abesher, in the year 1900. In order, too, to extend his influence
and safeguard his interests, he established a zawia at Bir Alali
about four days north of Lake Chad and wrote on three separate
occasions to Sultan Ali Dinar of Darfur requesting him to prepare
zawias for him in Jebel Marra and in Dar Zaghawa. The Sultan,
however, was unwilling to be saddled with such an illustrious but
inconvenient guest, and the matter eventually fell through in 1902.
From that time no visits of Senussiists to El Fasher have been
reported.</p>

<p>At last the situation in the west was brought to a head by a
French patrol searching a Senussiist zawia in Kanem for reported
arms. A collision ensued some time in August, 1901, which was
insignificant and partook of the nature of a raid. On 19th
November, however, a more serious collision took place, in which a
small French force was defeated by Sheikh el Barrani, the Senussi
representative in Kanem.</p>

<p>On the 18th January, 1902, the French, strongly reinforced,
attacked the Senussiists at the zawia of Alali, in Kanem, and the
latter, though assisted by the Aulad Suleiman (Tuareg) tribe,
sustained a severe defeat.</p>

<p>The Jehad was now proclaimed by the Senussi, and hundreds of his
adherents flocked into Geru from Tripoli, Wadai, and the
surrounding deserts. It appears, however, that the intention of the
Senussi was merely to act on the defensive, for no forward movement
was undertaken; there were even rumours that the Sheikh intended to
retire north to Kufra to avoid collision with the enemy. At a third
action, however, which appears to have been fairly decisive,
Mohammed Abu Egeil, the Senussi general in Kanem, was killed, and
the Senussiists fell back eastwards and northwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>During May,
1902, the Sheikh el Senussi sickened, owing, it is said, to his
anxiety regarding the situation. He is reported to have died on
30th May, and to have nominated his nephew, Ahmed el Sherif, as his
successor. The story of his death was not confirmed, and for a long
time rumours were rife of his appearance at Kufra, at Jaghbub,
etc., with the intention of proclaiming himself a Mahdi, of going
to Mecca on pilgrimage, etc., etc.; the shrine in which he was
buried was reported to have been opened, and found empty, and many
other stories of his reappearance were told. It seems, however,
most probable that he did die on or about the date given, and it is
certain that his successor has removed himself and all his property
back to Kufra.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Darfur.</span>In July Ali Dinar reported
that Arabi Dafaalla, ex-Dervish Emir on the Upper Nile, had
surrendered to him with all his men and 3,000 rifles, and had
received the âAman.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cholera.</span>During the summer the
cholera, which had been ravaging Egypt, made its appearance at
Halfa, and eight natives died. Owing, however, to the strict
surveillance there and at Suakin no further cases occurred in the
Sudan.</p>

<p>On the 20th July Major Hunter, Acting Commandant of Bahr el
Ghazal, died of blackwater fever.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">British garrison.</span>During the winter
of 1902-03 the British garrison of Khartoum was raised from one
company, which up to this time had remained only during the cold
weather, to a whole battalion, permanently quartered there.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Small disturbances.</span>Various small
raids into the Sudan took place during the years 1900-03 along the
Abyssinian frontier, the chief offenders being Wad Mahmud in the
Keili district, and a brigand named Hakos on the border near
Gallabat. Appeals to the higher Abyssinian authorities produced
little result, owing to their want of control over these outlying
districts. The end of these two brigands is recorded later.</p>

<p>In Kordofan the restless tribes of the southern hill districts
were never at peace, but the inter-tribal disturbances were purely
local, and in no way threatened the stability of the Government in
these parts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1903.</span>In the Eastern Sudan the
Rasheida slave-traders and the Gemilab tribe threatened at various
times to give trouble, but they have quieted down, and the latter
tribe has âcome in.â</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Delimitations.</span>At the end of 1902
Major C. W. Gwynn proceeded, with Major C. E. Wilson, to the
further delimitation of the Abyssinian frontier. He completed the
demarcation from the Setit to just south of Kirin, and returning,
<em>viÃ¢</em> Kodok, in May, 1903, settled the limits of the new
Sudanese leased territory of Itang on the Upper Baro River.</p>

<p>Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot also met the Italian delegates at
Kassala in February, 1903, and together they delimitated the
frontier from Abu Gamal to the Setit, opposite the mouth of the
Khor Royan, which point now forms the junction of Eritrea,
Abyssinia, and the Sudan (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_290">p.
290</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bahr el Ghazal.</span>Colonel Sparkes set
out on 13th January on a patrol to Hofrat el Nahas, the famous
copper mines in Southern Darfur. He arrived there on March 1st, and
was told that no European had visited it since 1876. The country
was totally deserted, and it was evident that if the mines were
worked, transport, although perhaps possible on the Bahr el Arab
during some parts of the year, would be a matter of great
difficulty. Colonel Sparkes returned to Deim Zubeir on 21st March,
having marched a distance of 667 miles.</p>

<p>A patrol was meanwhile sent to open up relations with the
powerful Azande chief, Yambio. Its commander, Captain Armstrong,
was most unfortunately killed by an elephant on the 23rd February,
and although the journey was continued by Colour-Sergeant Boardman,
R.M.A., the expedition did not meet with success, for on reaching
the Nyam Nyam country it was attacked by Yambioâs son (Mangi), and
had to retire, though without loss (except of baggage, etc.).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wadai.</span>After continual fighting
with Dud Murra, Ahmed El Ghazali was caught (20th March, 1903) in
an ambush; his eyes were put out, and he was kept a captive with
the Agid Salamat at Abesher. Wadai now became more or less settled,
and trade was reopened to the north and east.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bahr el Ghazal negotiations.</span>During
the past three years negotiations with the Government of the Congo
Free State on the subject of the Bahr el Ghazal have been taking
place; up to date, however, they have produced no definite
result.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shilluks.</span>In April, Kur Wad Nedok,
Mek of the Shilluks, was deposed for malpractices, and Fadiet Wad
Kwad Keir elected in his place.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kordofan. False prophet,
September.</span>On the 1st September, 1903, it was reported from
El Obeid that a certain Mohammed El Amin, who had recently returned
from Mecca and settled in Jebel Tagale, had proclaimed himself
Mahdi. Colonel Mahon, C.B., D.S.O., left Khartoum at once with a
squadron of cavalry, and marching <em>viÃ¢</em> the
Fachi-Shoya-Sherkeila route surprised and captured the false
prophet at Ageila without fighting. He was conducted to El Obeid,
where he was hanged on the 27th September.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">October.</span>It having been reported
that Mansur Abdel Rahman, a cousin of Sultan Ali Dinar of Darfur,
was raiding or collecting taxes from people in Kordofan, Captain
Carter proceeded with a small force of Camel Corps from El Eddaiya
and surprised the party, numbering some 40 rifles and horsemen, at
Sherafa, and captured Mansur, who was subsequently liberated after
the restoration of the property he had taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span><span class=

commenced in November, 1903.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Darfur.</span>During the summer of 1903
one or more treasonable conspiracies to seize the throne of Darfur
were nipped in the bud by the present Sultan Ali Dinar. Adam Rijal,
the Commandant of Jebel El Hella, and Tirab Suleiman, another
important general, both suffered the death penalty in consequence.
The ex-Dervish Emirs, Zogal and Karamalla Kirkesawi, were also both
mysteriously put out of the way.</p>

<p>In December, 1903, at the Sultanâs request, the boundaries of
Darfur were clearly explained to him in writing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mahmal.</span>The first Mahmal<a id=

of that country by Zubeir Pasha in 1873 arrived at Khartoum in
November. The value of the âSurraâ<a id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> was stated to be about
Â£450. The Mahmal proceeded <em>viÃ¢</em> Suakin to Jedda, and
returned to Khartoum at the end of June.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Upper Nile. Thalweg Agreement.</span>A
provisional agreement defining the Thalweg of the Nile between N.
Lat. 5Â° and 5Â° 30â² was drawn up on 13th September by Captain R. C.
R. Owen, representing the Sudan Government, and the late General
Utterwulghe, on behalf of the Government of the Congo Free
State.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Floods.</span>The winter of 1903-04 will
be memorable for the exceptional height of the Nile and its
tributaries in the Upper Nile region, consequent on which there
followed very extensive floods.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Eastern Sudan. Hakos.</span>The brigand
Hakos, who had caused considerable annoyance by raiding and robbery
along the frontier between the Setit and Gallabat, was reported to
have been killed on 16th December near Nogara. Had his career not
been thus suddenly terminated, the Emperor Menelik had agreed with
the Sudan Government to take combined action against him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abyssinian Coal Expedition.</span>An
expedition to prospect for coal in the valley of the Goang (Upper
Atbara), near Chelga, was despatched by the Sudan Government from
Khartoum in December, 1903.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1904. Itang.</span>Captain H. H. Wilson
left Kodok on the 23rd December, 1903, with merchants to establish
a trading station at Itang on the Baro. After making the
preliminary arrangements there he visited Ras Tesemma Nado at Gore.
His Excellency, the Governor-General, subsequently visited Itang in
May, 1904.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ibrahim Wad Mahmud.</span>In April, 1903,
after the delimitation of the Abyssinian frontier, Ibrahim Wad
Mahmud, the notorious slave raider of J. Jerok, was informed that
as his village fell within the limits of the Sudan, he must cease
raiding and settle down. As Ibrahim, however, in spite of a second
letter of warning, continued to raid and openly defied the
Government, in February a mixed force of about 800 men (partly
irregulars) with two guns was sent under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Gorringe (Governor, Sennar), to capture him. The
expedition was completely successful and Jebel Jerok was surprised;
Ibrahim, who succeeded in escaping, was handed over to Major G. de
H. Smith<a id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class=
"fnanchor">[217]</a> by Sheikh Hamed of Asosa on the 3rd of March.
He was subsequently brought to Wad Medani, where he was tried and
hanged on the 23rd May, 1904.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bahr El Ghazal. Lemaire
Expedition.</span>In October, 1903, a scientific mission hailing
from the Congo Free State, under the leadership of the explorer
Lemaire, arrived at Mvolo in the south-east Bahr El Ghazal. It
withdrew in the following spring, but was again seen in 1905.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1904. Yambio Patrol.</span>On the 27th
January a strong patrol, under the command of Captain P. Wood, left
Tonj to visit the Nyam Nyam Sultan Yambio. The object of the patrol
was to establish friendly relations with the Nyam Nyam chiefs
Riketa, Yambio, and Mangi. On arrival at Riketaâs (a son of Yambio,
and avowedly friendly), the patrol met with a treacherous and
hostile reception. Riketaâs village was accordingly destroyed, and
the patrol returned to Tonj. Captain H. E. Haymes, R.A.M.C., who
was wounded in the head, subsequently died at Tonj on the 15th
March.</p>

<p>Yambio is now dead. Owing to his persistent treachery and
hostility, a column under Major Boulnois was sent against him, and
in a smart action by Major Carter, February 9th, 1905, Yambio and
ten of his men were killed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sudan-Eritrean Frontier.</span>A
provisional agreement regarding a slight rectification of the
Sudan-Eritrea frontier near Karora was drafted by representatives
of both Governments in January. It has not yet been ratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Sudd.</span>The work of opening the 15th block of sudd
on the Bahr El Jebel was recommenced by Lieutenant Drury, late
R.N., in October, 1903, and continued during the succeeding 6
months, but eventually had to be again abandoned before the real
channel of the river had been entirely cleared. The clearing of
this block will probably be resumed, and it is hoped, completed in
1905.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kordofan.</span>In the spring of 1904, as
several of the Meks of the Nuba Mountains continued to disregard
Government orders to cease raiding and return looted property,
punitive measures of a minor description were undertaken after
repeated warnings, with most satisfactory results. In September,
1904, Major OâConnell with a force of 340 rifles, 3 guns and
friendlies, successfully enforced the submission of the Nubas of
Jabel Daier, about 60 miles south of El Obeid.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sketch of events in the Lado
Enclave.</span>After their defeat of the Dervishes at Rejaf in
February, 1897 (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>), the
Belgians, under Chaltin, proceeded to occupy the territory leased
to King Leopold under the Treaty of May, 1894, whilst Arabi
Dafaalla and his Dervishes retreated to his deim at Bor and thence,
at the end of 1898 or beginning of 1899, across the Bahr El Ghazal
to Kalaka and Dar Kara.</p>

<p>Chaltin at once commenced to build and fortify stations at Lado
(which had ceased to exist), Kiro, Loka, and Yei, whilst further
south, Dufile (now moved to New Dufile), and Mahaji, etc., were
occupied. At the end of 1901 Captain Hanolet was appointed
Commandant SupÃ©rieur of the Enclave, and continued to improve the
stations and communications with great energy. In August, 1903,
Captain Hanolet was replaced by Commissaire GÃ©nÃ©ral G. Utterwulghe.
The lamented death of this able and universally popular officer
took place at Yei on the 8th May, 1904; he was succeeded by
Commandant Wacquez.</p>

<p>Lado is now the headquarters of the Lado Enclave, whilst Yei, a
fortified military station on the river of that name, is next in
importance. Good roads connecting the stations on the Nile with Yei
are in course of construction, and automobiles are now being used
with some success to assist in the supply of the troops in the
Enclave. These number some 2,000-3,000 native regulars, who are
said to be excellent soldiers.</p>

<p>A railway connecting the Congo at Stanleyville with the shores
of Lake Albert Nyanza at Mahaji, immediately to the south of the
Enclave, is now in course of construction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mahdi on Blue Nile.</span>In August,
1904, a religious fanatic named Adam, having first obtained
promises of support from the Kenana Kawatil, openly declared
himself Mahdi in the Kenana Khot near Senga. Prompt measures were
taken to effect his arrest, and in the fight which ensued on his
refusal to surrender the Mahdi and the whole of his adherents (11),
were annihilated, while the Egyptian Mamur of Senga was
unfortunately killed by the rebels.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Progress in 1903-04</span>During
1903-1904 the Sudan Government extended its influence over and
established posts in some of the remotest parts of its territory.
In the north, the desert west of Dongola was widely explored and a
post established on the Arbain road. The Arab tribes living in the
wildest regions of the Southern Atbai were visited and much of this
country mapped. Further south, the heart of the district inhabited
by the redoubtable Gemilab tribe was reconnoitred and surveyed.
Posts were established in the little-known country, previously
infested by Abyssinian brigands, between the River Setit and
Gallabat, and in consequence of these measures for public security
the trade with Abyssinia at the latter place rapidly increased.</p>

<p>South of Roseires the administration was extended to the
mountainous district of J. Tabi, hitherto practically unexplored
and unknown, and inhabited by a shy and distinctive Negro race.
Further south, the country of the more northern Burun adjoining the
Abyssinian frontier and, until recently, the happy hunting ground
of border slave raiders, was pacified and effectively garrisoned by
regulars, whilst the opening up of trade routes from the border
districts of Abyssinia to the Blue and White Niles and Sobat was
commenced. In the Upper Nile Province, the Shilluk tribe was
brought under the more direct control of the Government, whilst
considerable progress was made with the Dinkas on the Sobat and the
deeply suspicious Nuers of the Bahr El Zeraf, whose country had
long remained unexplored by a white man. The Pibor river was
navigated for 170 miles beyond the Akobo junction, or 240 miles
from its mouth, and its source was roughly determined.</p>

<p>At Mongalla a suitable station was constructed and the almost
unknown tribes, Beri and Aliab, visited in the spring of 1904,
posts being established where necessary.</p>

<p>In the Bahr El Ghazal Province,<a id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> patrols traversed a
great part of the country and the main roads were improved
sufficiently to admit of the successful introduction of wheeled
transport. In Southern Kordofan effective administration was
extended, and detachments of regular troops were quartered
throughout the Nuba mountains.</p>

<p>The most important step taken by the Government during 1903-1904
for the economic development of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_280">[280]</span> the Sudan was the commencement of a railway
connecting the port of Suakin with the present main line near the
Atbara mouth. In addition, reconnaissances were carried out for a
branch line from Abu Hamed to Merowe and Affat in the Dongola
Province.</p>

<p>The future advancement of the country was further enhanced by
the efforts made by the Government to encourage the cultivation of
cotton, both by the issue of large grants of seed as well as by an
arrangement through which a fair price was guaranteed to the
producer for all cotton placed on the market.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Visits of distinguished persons.</span>It
only remains to be stated that in January 1900, and again in
February 1905, T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, and in
November 1901 His Highness the Khedive, visited Khartoum; a year
later General Lord Kitchener did the same and opened the Gordon
College; whilst Lord Cromer paid visits in December 1899, January
1901 and January 1903, proceeding as far as Gondokoro in the latter
year.</p>

<p>H.R.H. Princess Henry of Battenberg, accompanied by the
Princesses Victoria of Battenberg and Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg,
visited Khartoum in February 1904.</p>

<p>Sir William Garstin visited the White Nile, Bahr El Ghazal, Bahr
El Zeraf and Blue Nile in 1899-1904, and the Bahr El Jebel in 1901
and again in 1904, when he also explored the River Atem or
âGertrudeâ Nile. In 1903 he visited Uganda, Semliki River, Albert
Nyanza, as well as the Bahr El Jebel. The results of these journeys
have now been published, August 1904 (F.O. Blue Book, Egypt, No. 2,
1904).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Explorers.</span>The following noted
travellers, in addition to numerous distinguished sportsmen, have
passed through Khartoum at different times since 1898: Wellby,
Grogan, Donaldson-Smith, Henri, Gibbons, Neumann, Austin, Bright,
Lionel Decle, Macmillan, and Bulpett, Sir C. Eliot, Powell Cotton,
and Pierre. The latter arrived in January, 1904, from Zemio in Haut
Ubangi <em>viÃ¢</em> Deim Zubeir and Wau.</p>

<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> by a certain Queen of Egypt named
Shagar El Durr, of the Ayubite Dynasty, who prepared a very
sumptuous litter (hodag), on which she intended to visit Mecca by
camel. State affairs, however, prevented her making personal use of
the âhodag,â which she therefore sent to Mecca with presents of
money. This sending of the âhodagâ to Mecca gradually became a
custom, and was eventually copied in Syria. Nowadays a Mahmal
leaves Cairo and Damascus simultaneously each year, and consists of
a richly ornamented dome-shaped âhodagâ or litter which is carried
on a camel to Mecca and lodged in the âKaabaâ there until the
Mahmal returns, when it is taken back again. The richly embroidered
curtains, however, are presented to the âKaabaâ or Mosque.</p>

<p class="sch3b">AGREEMENT BETWEEN HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYâS
GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS HIGHNESS THE KHEDIVE OF EGYPT
RELATIVE TO THE FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SUDAN.</p>

<p>WHEREAS certain provinces in the Sudan which were in rebellion
against the authority of His Highness the Khedive have now been
reconquered by the joint military and financial efforts of Her
Britannic Majestyâs Government and the Government of His Highness
the Khedive;</p>

<p>AND whereas it has become necessary to decide upon a system for
the administration of and for the making of laws for the said
reconquered provinces, under which due allowance may be made for
the backward and unsettled condition of large portions thereof, and
for the varying requirements of different localities;</p>

<p>AND whereas it is desired to give effect to the claims which
have accrued to Her Britannic Majestyâs Government, by right of
conquest, to share in the present settlement and future working and
development of the said system of administration and
legislation;</p>

<p>AND whereas it is conceived that for many purposes Wadi Halfa
and Suakin may be most effectively administered in conjunction with
the reconquered provinces to which they are respectively
adjacent;</p>

<p>Now, it is hereby agreed and declared by and between the
Undersigned, duly authorized for that purpose, as follows:â</p>

<p class="center space-above15">ARTICLE I.</p>

<p>The word âSudanâ in this Agreement means all the territories
South of the 22nd parallel of latitude, which:</p>

<p>1. Have never been evacuated by Egyptian troops since the year
1882; or</p>

<p>2. Which having before the late rebellion in the Sudan been
administered by the Government of His Highness the Khedive, were
temporarily lost to Egypt, and have been reconquered by Her
Majestyâs Government and the Egyptian Government, acting in
concert; or</p>

<p>3. Which may hereafter be reconquered by the two Governments
acting in concert.</p>

<p class="center space-above15">ARTICLE II.</p>

<p>The British and Egyptian flags shall be used together, both on
land and water, throughout the Sudan, except in the town of Suakin,
in which locality the Egyptian flag alone shall be used.</p>

<p class="center space-above15">ARTICLE III.</p>

<p>The supreme military and civil command in the Sudan shall be
vested in one officer, termed the âGovernor-General of the Sudan.â
He shall be appointed by Khedivial Decree on the recommendation of
Her Britannic Majestyâs Government, and shall be removed only by
Khedivial Decree, with the consent of Her Britannic Majestyâs
Government.</p>

<p class="center space-above15"><span class="pagenum" id=

<p>Laws, as also Orders and Regulations with the full force of law,
for the good government of the Sudan, and for regulating the
holding, disposal, and devolution of property of every kind therein
situate, may from time to time be made, altered, or abrogated by
Proclamation of the Governor-General. Such Laws, Orders and
Regulations may apply to the whole or any part named of the Sudan,
and may, either explicitly or by necessary implication, alter or
abrogate any existing Law or Regulation.</p>

<p class="space-above15">All such Proclamations shall forthwith be
notified to Her Britannic Majestyâs Agent and Consul-General in
Cairo, and to the President of the Council of Ministers of His
Highness the Khedive.</p>

<p>No Egyptian Law, Decree, Ministerial ArrÃªtÃ©, or other enactment

Proclamation of the Governor-General in manner hereinbefore
provided.</p>

limits, no special privileges shall be accorded to the subjects of
any one or more Power.</p>

<p class="center space-above15">ARTICLE VII.</p>

<p>Import duties on entering the Sudan shall not be payable on
goods coming from Egyptian territory. Such duties may, however, be
levied on goods coming from elsewhere than Egyptian territory, but
in the case of goods entering the Sudan at Suakin, or any other
port on the Red Sea littoral, they shall not exceed the
corresponding duties for the time being leviable on goods entering
Egypt from abroad. Duties may be levied on goods leaving the Sudan,
at such rates as may from time to time be prescribed by
Proclamation.</p>

<p>No Consuls, Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents shall be accredited
in respect of nor allowed to reside in the Sudan, without the
previous consent of Her Britannic Majestyâs Government.</p>

<p class="center space-above15">ARTICLE XI.</p>

<p>The importation of slaves into the Sudan, as also their
exportation, is absolutely prohibited. Provision shall be made by
Proclamation for the enforcement of this Regulation.</p>

<p>It is agreed between the two Governments that special attention
shall be paid to the enforcement of the Brussels Act of 2nd July,
1890, in respect to the import, sale, and manufacture of fire-arms
and their munitions, and distilled or spirituous liquors.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, under our Agreement made the 19th day of January, 1899,
relative to the future administration of the Sudan, it is provided
by Article VIII. that the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals shall
not extend nor be recognised for any purpose whatsoever in any part

Suakin by the absence of any local jurisdiction for the settlement
of their disputes, and it is expedient that the town of Suakin
should be placed upon the same footing as the rest of the
Sudan;</p>

accordingly in manner hereinafter appearing;</p>

<p>NOW, it is hereby agreed and declared by and between the

administration of the Sudan, are hereby abrogated.</p>

<p class="sch3">[<em>Ratifications exchanged at Paris, June</em>
13. 1899.]</p>

<p>The undersigned, duly authorised by their Governments, have
signed the following Declaration:â</p>

<p>The IVth Article of the Convention of the 14th June, 1898, shall
be completed by the following provisions, which shall be considered
as forming an integral part of it:â</p>

<p>1. Her Britannic Majestyâs Government engages not to acquire
either territory or political influence to the west of the line of
frontier defined in the following paragraph, and the Government of
the French Republic engages not to acquire either territory or
political influence to the east of the same line.</p>

<p>2. The line of frontier shall start from the point where the
boundary between the Congo Free State and French territory meets
the water-parting between the watershed of the Nile and that of the
Congo and its affluents. It shall follow in principle that
water-parting up to its intersection with the 11th parallel of
north latitude. From this point it shall be drawn as far as the
15th parrallel in such manner as to separate, in principle, the
Kingdom of Wadai from what constituted in 1882 the Province of
Darfur; but it shall in no case be so drawn as to pass to the west
beyond the 21st degree of longitude east of Greenwich (18Â° 40â² east
of Paris), or to the east beyond the 23rd degree of longitude east
of Greenwich (20Â° 40â² east of Paris).</p>

<p>3. It is understood, in principle, that to the north of the 15th
parrallel the French zone shall be limited to the north-east and
east by a line which shall start from the point of intersection of
the Tropic of Cancer with the 16th degree of longitude east of
Greenwich (13Â° 40â² east of Paris), shall run thence to the
south-east until it meets the 24th degree of longitude east of
Greenwich (21Â° 40â² east of Paris), and shall then follow the 24th
degree until it meets, to the north of the 15th parallel of
latitude, the frontier of Darfur as it shall eventually be
fixed.</p>

<p>4. The two Governments engage to appoint Commissioners who shall
be charged to delimit on the spot a frontier-line in accordance
with the indications given in paragraph 2 of this Declaration. The
result of their work shall be submitted for the approbation of
their respective Governments.</p>

<p>It is agreed that the provisions of Article IX of the Convention
of the 14th June, 1898, shall apply equally to the territories
situated to the south of the 14Â° 20â² parallel of north latitude,
and to the north of the 5th parallel of north latitude, between the
14Â° 20â² meridian of longitude east of Greenwich (12th degree east
of Paris) and the course of the Upper Nile.</p>

<p class="sch3">AGREEMENT <em>re</em> TRIBES BETWEEN KHOR BARAKA
AND RED SEA.</p>

<p>With a view to establishing in a permanent manner the dependence
of the semi-nomadic tribes which exist on the frontier between the
Baraka and the Red Sea, and to determining precisely the frontier
separating the Italian and Egyptian territory in this region, H.E.
Ferik Sir Herbert Kitchener, Pasha, Sirdar of the Egyptian Army,
and H.E. Cavaliere Oreste Baratieri, Lieut. General, Governor of
the Colony of Eritrea, authorised by their respective Governments
have agreed to the following articles:â</p>

<p>I. In the district between the Red Sea and the Baraka, the
frontier line between Egypt and Eritrea shall follow a line which,
starting from Ras Kasar joins the principal branch of the Karora
about 2 kilom. from the coast, and follows the course of the Karora
up to a point marked Karora on the map. The frontier then follows
the watershed between the torrents Aiet and Merib on the north and
the torrents Falkat and Sela on the south, up to a point on the
plateau of Hagar Nush, to be fixed by the delineators, and from
that point so fixed shall proceed to join the Baraka at a point
which is also left to the delineators to establish, following a
clearly determined natural line. From the Baraka, the line of
frontier goes straight to the intersection of the 17th parallel
north with the 37th meridian east of Greenwich.</p>

<p>II. The semi-nomadic tribes on the frontier known as the
Hazerandowa (Ad-Azeri), Felunda (Aflenda), Beit Maleh, and
Rashaida, together with the sections of the Beni Amer at present
acknowledging the authority of Sheikh Idris Hamen, are recognised
as dependent on the Egyptian Government; and the Beni Amer
acknowledging Sheikhs Ali Husseid, and Mahmud Sherif, as well as
the Hababs, are recognised as dependent on the Government of
Eritrea.</p>

<p>III. The two Governments bind themselves to concede
reciprocally, reserving themselves the power of imposing a moderate
tax in payment, rights of pasturage and cultivation in their
respective territories to such alien tribes as apply for the
concession through their respective Governments. Such concession
shall be limited only by the requirements of public safety and by
the needs of other local tribes dependent on the Government giving
the concession.</p>

<p>IV. The two Governments bind themselves reciprocally to oppose
as far as is practicable, and without necessarily having recourse
to force, the settlement in their respective territories of tribes
who may cross the frontier in consequence of rebellion or defection
of their chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>In the interests
of public tranquility, the two Governments further bind themselves
to take into consideration according to the circumstances of each
case, the expediency of total or partial disarmament of the tribes
on the frontier, due allowance being made for the requirements of
their defence.</p>

<p>Each of the two Governments, however, reserves to itself full
liberty to decide upon the measures which it shall take in its own
territory, both as regards the means of opposing the immigration of
rebellious tribes, and in respect to the time, method and extent of
the disarmament to which this article refers.</p>

KHOR BARAKA, AS SETTLED BY THE PARSONS-MARTINI AGREEMENT, SIGNED AT
ASMARA, 7<span class="sc">th</span> DECEMBER, 1898.</p>

<p>Being desirous of determining the Sudan and Italian frontier
between Ras Kasar and Baraka, and thus ratifying the
Kitchener-Baratieri Convention of the 7th July, 1895, the
undersigned, El Lewa Parsons Pasha, Governor of Suakin and
Commandant of Kassala Station, on behalf of His Highness the
Khedive of Egypt; and Chevalier Ferdinando Martini, Extraordinary
Civil Commissioner of the Colony of Eritrea, on behalf of His
Majesty the King of Italy, have agreed as follows:â</p>

<p>Art. I. Starting from the Cape of Ras Kasar on the Red Sea the
frontier between the Sudan and Eritrea follows a line which,
following the heights of Halabai (Halibai) and Gaba Keli
(Gabei-Helli) joins the bed of the Karora (Carora) and ascends the
latter to the heights of Tefleinai (Teflanait), whence <em>viÃ¢</em>
Abbeinedu mountain it reaches the watershed between the valleys of
Karora (Carora) and Tabbeh (Tabeh) on the south and the Aitara
(Aitera) and Areirib (Arerib) on the north, it then runs in a
westerly direction along the above-mentioned watershed to the
hillock of Mashonkole (Sciancolet), and thence by the slopes of
Sigat Alim (Sigat Tellim) it reaches a little to the north of
Roribet mountain, the plateau of Hagar Nush (Nusch); thence it
follows its northern edge to the summit of Hamoiet (Hamoet) and
along the Hafta (Afta) torrent to the wells of the same name,
thence to Jebel Aar (Monte Haar) over the undulating region which
forms the watershed between the middle course of the Ambakta
(Ambacta) and the Lui (Loi) torrent; from that rocky region it
proceeds to the Baraka (Barca) and joins it at its confluence with
the Ambakta (Ambacta) following the slopes which limit on the north
the lower portion of this last named valley.</p>

<p>Art. II. Two Commissioners, delegated one by the Egyptian
Government, and the other by the Italian Government, will proceed
within six months to demarcate the frontier by erecting boundary
pillars.</p>

<p>From the point of junction of the Ambakta with the Baraka, the

up-stream to its junction with the Khor Dada, and then turning in a
westerly direction follows the Dada throughout its course to its

<p class="sch3">DESCRIPTION OF THE LINE AGREED UPON FOR THE
RECTIFICATION OF THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN SUDAN AND
THE COLONY OF ERYTHRÃA. (<em>With Map.</em>)</p>

<p>The rectified boundary shall run from the highest summit of
Jebel Abu Gamal to the highest point of the group of low hills
known as El Burak, situated on the magnetic bearing of 175Â° from
Abu Gamal and 14 kilometres distant.</p>

<p>From El Burak it shall run in a straight line to the eastern
ridge of the Koraiteb Hills, passing through the highest rock of
this ridge, the highest of the whole group, and leaving to the
Sudan the water-holes in the Koraiteb Rocks to the west of this
line. The Sudan Government, however, shall allow ErythrÃ¦an subjects
with caravans from Sogada to Noggara, or <em>vice versÃ¢</em>, or
engaged in collecting gum in ErythrÃ¦an territory, to use these
water-holes. This privilege shall not be extended to hunters in
ErythrÃ¦an territory.</p>

<p>Between El Burak and Koraiteb, owing to the necessity of
avoiding the tracts of pathless bush so frequently met with in this
waterless area, the Commission was compelled to keep to the west of
the direct line. It was, consequently, impossible to do more than
to ascertain that the little hill of Murawi, the ridge of Ginjar,
or Wad Ganjar, and the pond or marsh of Um Sagit, lie within Sudan
territory without constituting them boundary points.</p>

<p>From Koraiteb the boundary shall pass in a straight line to the
conspicuous clump of trees surrounded by stones at the western end
of the hill known as J. Nuwar, and from there, on a magnetic
bearing of 166Â°, to the road cleared this winter by Bimbashi Savile
between Umbrega and El Hafeira, and striking it on the ridge
between Wad Mizammil and El Hafeira at a distance of about 520
metres, measured along the track from the point where it crosses
the nearest water channel immediately west of the ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>The right of
passage between the hills of J. Nuwar and J. El Batiota, as through
the area known as El Makhram El Batiota, shall be enjoyed by the
subjects of both Governments.</p>

<p>From the above-mentioned point on the Umbrega-El Hafeira road,
now marked by a blazed âhegligâ tree on the north side of the road,
the boundary shall run straight to the bend of the Setit
immediately opposite the mouth of the Khor Royan.</p>

ABYSSINIAN-SUDANESE-ERYTHRÃAN FRONTIERS.</p>

<p>It is agreed that, in order to complete the delimitation of the
frontier between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and ErythrÃ¦a, a line
shall be drawn from Abu Gamal (<em>see</em> Talbot-Colli map) to be
eventually demarcated by special delegates in accordance with
geographical features, in a southerly direction as far as the
junction of the Khor Um Hagar with the River Setit. (<em>See</em>
Talbot-Colli map 36Â° 37â² east long.)</p>

<p>The territory to the east of this line which has been recognised
as Sudanese territory by the Emperor Menelik shall be transferred,
subject to his consent, to ErythrÃ¦a.</p>

<p>The parallelogram west of this line and north of the
Tomat-Todluk line shall be ceded by Italy to the Sudan.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this arrangement the boundary line between
the Sudan and Abyssinia from the Setit to Matamma shall be
deflected towards the west, so as to leave on the Abyssinian side
Nogara and the trade-route from Gondar northwards towards
ErythrÃ¦a.</p>

<p>The British and Italian Agents in Abyssinia will work together
in concert to obtain from the Emperor Menelik in return for this
extension of the Abyssinian boundary, a zone of territory to the
East of Todluk-Maieteb line, which will give to ErythrÃ¦a the whole
of the Kunama tribe up to the Mareb.</p>

<p>Should these negotiations, after a reasonable lapse of time,
prove unsuccessful, negotiations shall be resumed in Rome between
the Italian and British delegates with the object of tracing the
boundary between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Abyssinia on the
basis of the Todluk-Ombrega or Maieteb-Jebel Obar lines, whilst, as
regards the boundary between the Sudan and ErythrÃ¦a, the <em>status
quo ante</em> of the territory North of the Tomat-Todluk line shall
be preserved.</p>

<p>The arrangement contemplated in the present declaration shall be
regarded as secret until the consent of the Emperor Menelik has
been obtained.</p>

one thousand nine hundred and one.</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that the Sudan
Government has had under consideration the question of duties to be
paid on goods coming from Uganda into or passing through the
Sudan.</p>

<p>It has been decided that the Customs Convention<a id=
"FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class=

such goods under the following conditions:â</p>

<p>1. Certificates of origin should be furnished by the Uganda
authorities in order to facilitate and ensure the efficient
collection of the proper Customs dues.</p>

<p>2. In the event of goods not specially specified in Article VI
of the Convention being imported into the Sudan from Uganda, there
shall be levied the following:â</p>

<p class="pad6">(<em>a</em>) On goods proved to the satisfaction of
the Sudanese Custom House authorities to be the <em>bonÃ¢ fide</em>
natural produce of Uganda, a duty equal to that payable under the
Egyptian Tariff for the time being in force on the importation into
Egypt of the like goods coming from any third country but in no
case to exceed 5 per cent.</p>

<p class="pad6">(<em>b</em>) On other goods, a duty equal to that
payable under the Egyptian Tariff above-mentioned without the 5 per
cent. reservation. This duty is at present 8 per cent. <em>ad
valorem</em> on most articles.</p>

<p>3. On gum, india-rubber, ivory, ostrich feathers, etc., etc., an
import duty in accordance with (<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>) and in
addition the existing royalty (20 per cent. at present), minus the
amount of the import duty paid under (<em>a</em>) or
(<em>b</em>).</p>

<p>In other words, imported goods which are liable to pay royalty
in the Sudan are allowed a drawback of the original amount of
import duty paid.</p>

<p>4. (<em>a</em>) Goods duly sealed and accompanied by
certificates of origin delivered by Uganda Authorities, passing in
transit through Anglo-Egyptian territory, other than goods imported
into Egypt and not intended for re-exportation thence, shall be
entitled to a drawback of the whole of the duty paid on their entry
into the Sudan, <em>i.e.</em>, of import duty, or of royalty, or of
both.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The maximum time allowed for goods passing in

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">General description. (Editor.)</span>The
âsuddâ (in Arabic <em>sadd</em> = block) is a generic name by
custom applied to the huge marshes through which the Bahr El Jebel,
Bahr El Ghazal, Bahr El Zeraf and the lower portion of their
tributaries wind their way. It forms an irregular triangle of which
the northern base extends about 200 miles west from the mouth of
the Bahr El Zeraf, and the southern apex lies about Bor, 250 miles
S.S.E. of Lake No. It is difficult to estimate the area of these
vast marshes, but it cannot be much less than 35,000 square
miles.</p>

<p>These marshes are formed by the expansion of the rivers
mentioned over this area, and probably represent the bed of an old
prehistoric lake which has to a certain extent dried up. The theory
has been put forward that in those far-off days a ridge about
Kodok, subsequently broken through by the river, caused the
holding-up of waters in this lake, but this is hardly the place to
examine this theory in detail.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that a great part of this area is covered with
a shallow sheet of water, over almost the whole extent of which
thick reeds and swamp-grasses have sprung up. Except in the actual
river channels this water is probably nowhere more than 2 to 6 feet
deep.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Scenery.</span>To the eye the effect is
one of a vast extent of brilliant green papyrus, feathery reeds and
sword-grass, 5 to 15 feet above the water, broken by occasional
patches of light ambach trees, with channels of water, pools and
lagoons dotting the âswamp-scape,â and here and there a sparse tree
or two on the horizon. Occasionally, and more especially towards
the south, ridges, or patches of mud or solid ground are visible,
<span class="sidenote">Animal life.</span>and in such parts there
is much bird and animal life. In the lower (northern) reaches of
the Sudd nearly all signs of lifeâexcept the brilliant little
bee-eater,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> an
occasional heron, fish-eagle, or âanvil bird,â the ubiquitous
crocodile, and, of course, the insectsâdisappear; but in the more
southerly parts are found many varieties of game.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>On the Bahr El Jebel,
for the first 150 miles south of Lake No there are no human
inhabitants visible. Thereafter occasional Dinkas and their
villages are seen up to about Bor (384 miles); whilst beyond this
the Bari country commences, the population as the Lado Enclave is
approached being considerably thicker on the east than on the west
bank. The Bahr el Ghazal swamps and banks are almost
uninhabited.</p>

<p>Of the larger species of game, elephant, giraffe, buffalo, and
many sorts of antelope, including waterbuck, Leucotis, Cobus Maria,
etc., etc., are seen towards the south, whilst the hippopotamus is
excessively numerous almost throughout.<a id=
"FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class=
"fnanchor">[228]</a> From the reeds and mudbanks arise clouds of
wildfowl, crane, geese, (black and white, and brown), storks
(saddleback, black, open-billed and marabou), herons (white, grey,
egret, purple, âsquacco,â and âGoliathâ), bustard, and the quaint
<i>balaeniceps rex</i> (whale-headed stork), besides pelican,
spoonbill, ibis, and duck of every description; and of insect life
the supply is unnecessarily large throughout. This latter includes
several varieties of persistent and poisonous mosquitos (from the
large scarlet one to the tiny anopheles), the trumpet-headed sudd
insect and other kindred grasshopper-like creatures, millions of
midges and mayflies, the serÃ»t fly, moths, spiders, fireflies,
etc., etc. The sudd also swarms with coarse fish, some running to a
considerable size.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The true Sudd.</span>Some confusion has
been caused by the word âsuddâ being applied to the whole of these
marshes. As a matter of fact, the real sudd is only the obstructive
floating vegetation, originated in the lagoons as described below,
which is driven by force of circumstances into the river channels
and there forms the block or sudd. By far the greater portion of
the marshes are covered by standing reeds, papyrus and the like,
which, although they cover and assist in the formation of the
floating vegetation and even, when uprooted, form part of it, yet
are not, strictly speaking, sudd in their original state.</p>

<p>Thus, the traveller who proceeds along the cleared channel from
Lake No to Gondokoro will, in all probability, although in the
middle of the âsudd,â see little, if any, genuine sudd at all.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Formation of Sudd. (Sir W.
Garstin.)</span>In the Bahr El Jebel the main factors in forming
sudd are the papyrus and the âum sÃ»f.â These two, with the earth
adhering to their roots, form the real obstruction. Many of the
smaller swimming plants, such as the â<i>Azolla</i>â the
â<i>Utricularia</i>â and the â<i>Otellia Vallisneria</i>â are
mingled with the others, but they certainly do not play an
important part in the formation of the obstacle. The ambach, too,
has been unjustly accused of assisting in forming this barrier.
This is not the case. This plant does not grow in any great
quantity in the vicinity of the Bahr El Jebel, and its stem is so
light and brittle that it would break when subjected to great
pressure.</p>

<p>On the Bahr El Ghazal, on the contrary, the sudd is chiefly
composed of the swimming plants above-mentioned. Their breeding
places are Lake Ambadi and the other shallow lakes to the
south.</p>

<p>The Ghazal sudd is much lighter in texture than that of the
Jebel, and is consequently much easier to remove. At the same time,
even in the former river, the sudd is at times dangerous,
especially if it forms down-stream of a vessel, and if the latter
has to work upon it from its up-stream end. The accident to Gessi
Pashaâs expedition in 1880 proves that even the Bahr El Ghazal sudd
can be an impassable obstacle under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Before alluding to the work done in removing the sudd, it may be
as well to say a few words as to the principal causes of this
remarkable barrier.</p>

<p>The Bahr El Jebel traverses the marshes between Bor and Lake No
for some 380 miles of its course. South of Shambe the river has
never been known to be blocked. On either side of the channel, in
these immense swamps, extend large shallow lagoons, some of them
covering a square mile or more of area. These lagoons are
surrounded on every side by a luxuriant growth of aquatic plants,
consisting chiefly of the papyrus and the grass known to the Arabs
as the âum sÃ»fâ (the mother of wool). Both these plants grow in
water, but not in any great depth. The papyrus attains a height of
from 15 to 20 feet, with fibrous roots which strike deep into the
ground. The âum sÃ»fâ rarely exceeds 5 feet in height, and its roots
do not extend so deeply as do those of the papyrus. They are,
however, very tough and difficult to break or cut through. These
roots are bedded in the soil below the water, but the strong gales
which blow in these regions loosen their hold to a large extent. If
such a storm be accompanied by any rise of the water surface, large
masses of these plants are set free from their original position,
and begin to float on the surface of the lagoons. Their roots form
such a tangled mass that large quantities of the earth in which
they are embedded remain clinging to them. These act as ballast,
and when the island of papyrus or reeds is detached and, under the
influence of the wind, is set drifting about the lagoon, the weight
of the earth retains the plants in their vertical position. Their
roots, the moment they reach a shallow, act as anchors, and
speedily strike down again into the muddy bottom of the lake. Large
masses constantly change their position in this way. If the storm
cease, they remain where they are. Unfortunately, at the
commencement and end of the rainy season, stormy weather is the
rule rather than the exception. At such seasons large areas of the
marsh vegetation are in motion, driven hither and thither by the
wind.</p>

<p>The Bahr El Jebel, where it passes through the swamps, has no
banks whatever, and is, as a rule, separated from the lagoons
merely by a narrow belt of papyrus. In many places it is in
connection with them, and the water of the lakes<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> flows in and out of the river,
according to the level of the latter. As the stormy season in these
latitudes heralds the approach of the annual rains, the rise of the
river follows very speedily. The channel of the Bahr El Jebel being
only of sufficient section to carry the low water supply, with the
first rise in the levels the river spreads over the marshes,
flooding them in all directions, and increasing the depth of water
in the lagoons. It thus causes the areas of reed, already detached
by the wind, to float still more easily. The continuous gales which
prevail set hundreds of acres of these floating masses moving in
one direction. Eventually they reach a point on the river where
they are forced into the channel. Once there the current speedily
carries them down-stream. Ere long their course is arrested by a
projection on the edge of the channel or by a sharp bend. It may
happen that an area of reed, several acres in extent, bursts into
the river in a large sheet, and in such a case it must be
necessarily arrested at the first point where the section is
contracted. The result is that the channel is quickly blocked,
though, perhaps, not at first to any great depth. Masses of weed,
however, follow one another in succession, brought down by the
stream. The section of the channel being reduced by the first
obstruction, the velocity of the water rapidly increases, and these
masses, following the easiest course, pass under the obstacle thus
created. Each fresh mass arriving is sucked underneath those
originally arrested, until at last the whole becomes wedged into
one solid block, composed partly of earth and partly of stalks and
roots of papyrus and reed, broken up by the extreme compression
into an inextricable tangle. So great is the pressure applied by
the water, that the surface of the block is often forced several
yards above the water-level and is seamed by alternate ridges and
furrows. The thickness varies greatly, according to the conditions
and sections of the channel. In some cases it is not more than 4 to
6 feet, but it not infrequently obtains a thickness of 16 feet,
below water, and occasionally as much as 22 feet have been
observed.<a id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class=
"fnanchor">[229]</a> Underneath this bar the river manages to force
an outlet, but with a velocity increased proportionately to the
smallness of the aperture. At the same time, the up-stream level
rises, flooding the marshes in every direction, the water making
use of any side channel that it can find. In time, doubtless, if
left to itself, it would desert its original course, and the stream
would take an entirely new direction, the original channel becoming
permanently blocked. It generally, however, happens from natural
causes, such as strong winds or increased heading-up of the water,
that these blocks burst, and the obstacle is carried away. On such
occasions a great wave passes down the channel, carrying everything
before it, and sweeping away any similar blocks which may have been
formed down-stream. Only in this way can the clearance of the sudd
in certain years which has undoubtedly occurred be explained. Many
of these blocks extend for a considerable length, some being as
much as several miles long. It is easy to understand that such
closures of the river channel cause not only a complete bar to
navigation, but also a very serious obstacle to the free passage of
the water. More than this, each block thus formed assists in the
formation of others, by raising the water level up-stream, and thus
assisting the flotation of further areas of papyrus and reed, much
of which eventually finds its way into the river.</p>

<p>The movement of these great masses of weed, and the way in which
they burst into the river, bears a striking resemblance to the
descriptions given of an icefield when in motion. Their steady and
resistless movement, the manner in which the fields break up, and
the way in which they pile upon one another when an obstruction is
encountered to their course, recall irresistibly what travellers
relate of the action of the ice-floes when the pack is breaking
up.</p>

<p>The sudd in this river, and in a less degree that in the Bahr El
Ghazal, constitutes a very real danger to navigation. Should a
steamer happen to be surrounded by it when in motion, the
compression would certainly strain her framework to the risk of
crushing it. Even should she escape this she will most probably be
imprisoned for an indefinite time, owing to the river blocking on
either side of her. During the stormy season, it should if possible
always be arranged that two steamers should work in conjunction,
one remaining down-stream, so as to be able to go to the assistance
of the other if necessary.</p>

<p>As no fuel is to be met with throughout the whole length of the
sudd region, a solitary steamer, if detained for some time by a
block, may find herself eventually prevented from proceeding, or
from making any attempt to free herself, owing to the absence of
any means of generating steam in her boilers.</p>

<p>The Bahr El Ghazal sudd is, as has been said, of a different
kind to that of the Bahr El Jebel. It is, as a rule, much lighter
in consistency and easier to remove. This is doubtless due to the
fact that the velocity of this river is very low, and,
consequently, the pressure exerted by the water upon a block is
small compared with that caused by similar conditions in the Bahr
El Jebel. Again, on the Bahr El Ghazal, the papyrus and reeds do
not extend on either side to any distance, nor are continuous and
large lagoons close at hand. Between miles 42 and 52, up-stream of
the junction with the Khor Deleib, there must, it is true, be
always a risk of a block. In this reach the river passes through
papyrus swamps, which are miniature editions of the Jebel marshes.
Even here, however, the obstruction can hardly attain to the same
solidity as in the case of the Jebel sudd, as the sluggish current
of the Ghazal would fail to wedge the mass between the banks as
tightly as would the rapid stream of the other river. Lake Ambadi
appears to be a great nursery for the smaller varieties of the sudd
plants. In the beginning of the rainy season these<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> are carried down-stream and,
as the channel wanders and twists, they form small obstructions.
None of these, however, appear to be lasting, and it is rare that
the Ghazal river is blocked for any length of time. It may be
closed for a few months and then re-open itself. Thus in March and
April, 1900, it was clear throughout its entire length, while in
September of the same year it was blocked in more than one place.
On this river, as on the Jebel, the sudd frequently sinks to the
bottom, and decomposes, gradually raising the bed of the river. In
this state it is very hard to remove.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Botanical Composition.</span>The
sudd-forming plants may be classed in three divisions.<a id=
"FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class=
"fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The first, which contains plants whose roots descend to the
river bed, is chiefly composed of the papyrus (<i>Cyperus
Papyrus</i>), the common reed or âBusâ (<i>Phragmites
communis</i>), and the feathery-headed grass (<i>Saccharum
Spontaneum</i>).</p>

<p>The second kind is composed entirely of plants whose roots are
in the water, but do not strike down to the ground or bed of river.
The principal plant in this class is the âUm sÃ»fâ (<i>Panicum
pyramidale</i>), grass, so called by the Arabs (âMother of woolâ)
on account of the irritant hairs found on its leaf-sheaths which
adhere to the skin of anyone touching them. In addition to the
above, the wild bean (<i>Vigna Nilotica</i>) and creepers with
purple flowers (<i>IpomÅa</i>) are found in profusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>The third or
last class of sudd is composed entirely of plants which swim upon
the surface of the water. These form the cementing medium which
binds the first two classes together.</p>

<p>The following are the principal components of this class:â</p>

<p><i>Pistia</i>, a small cabbage-like plant with bright green
leaves. <i>Azolla</i>, resembling moss in texture.
<i>Utricularia</i>, <i>Aldrovandia</i> and <i>Ceratophyllum</i>,
all resembling feathery floating streamers. The first variety has a
series of small bulbs, like floats, attached to each streamer. The
last is common in the canals and drains of Lower Egypt.</p>

<p><i>Otellia</i>, a plant with big leaves and a white flower like
a lily.<a id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class=
"fnanchor">[231]</a> It is found everywhere in this class of sudd,
and is met with at Damietta, where it is called by the Arabs
âLughmet el Kadi,â or the âKadiâs pudding.â</p>

<p>In and among the above the blue-flowered creeper
(<i>Commellaria</i>) is found.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Detail. (Mr. Broun.)</span>Regarding the
detail of the formation, the first point of interest is that all
the most important sudd plants propagate themselves by means of
tubular rhizomes which run along the surface of the water giving
out shoots from point to point. These shoots, after developing,
give out other runners which cross the others and weave themselves
into them, a further consolidation being given by twiners which
bind them all together.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Chief sudd plants.</span>The most
important sudd plants are, without doubt, Papyrus, âUm sÃ»fâ
(<i>Panicum pyramidale</i>), and âBusâ (<i>Phragmites
communis</i>).</p>

<p>âUm sÃ»fâ is probably the greatest source of blocks in the river
courses, as it seems to thrive in deeper water than either the
âPapyrusâ or âBus.â But all these give out long rhizomes. Those of
the âBus,â which is a very tall reed, extend sometimes quite 20
yards from the parent plants. These rhizomes either break away when
the new shoots have developed and go to form new colonies
elsewhere, or they are driven by the side of the others and
gradually encroach on the river.</p>

<p>Among the climbers which bind the new growth (as well as the
old) together, the principal are three kinds of <i>IpomÅa</i>, one
vine and a leguminous twiner <i>Vigna Nilotica</i>. One of the
<i>IpomÅas</i> (<i>I. Reptans</i>) deserves special mention, as it
is not only a twiner, but possesses also tubular rhizomes, which
enable it to float along the rhizomes of Papyrus, âBus,â or âUm
sÃ»f,â and to knit them together as soon as they give out shoots.
Among other plants which have also hollow stems are <i>JussiÃ¦a
diffusa</i>, which is also supplied with bunches of spine-shaped
floats, and <i>Polygonum tomentosum</i>.</p>

<p>When all these floating masses are being tied together by the
twiners the river brings down other plants as a packing to fill the
interstices. The most common is <i>Pistia Stratiotes</i>, but there
is also a constant supply of <i>Ceratophyllum</i>,
<i>Utricularia</i>, <i>Vallisneria</i> and other plants of the same
family; also <i>Trapa bispinosa</i> (the water-nut),
<i>Potomogetum</i>, <i>Azolla</i>, etc. Little nooks are thus
enclosed by runners from the Bus reed, the interior spaces of which
are crammed with smaller plants.</p>

<p>It appears wonderful that with all this enormous mass of
vegetation growing in these vast swamps in which no traces of human
habitations can be seen, the natural decay of the plants does not
gradually raise the level of the soil and force the water to keep
to well-defined channels which, with the greater volume of water
which they would contain would soon force for themselves a less
winding course than they now follow.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Action of fires.</span>It appears that
one of the chief causes of continuation of the old order of things
is <em>fire</em>. Sparsely inhabited as the swamps are, they are
swept through from end to end by fierce fires which carry
everything before them and kill nearly all the trees which attempt
to gain a footing. Here and there a few Kakamut, DÃ´m, Deleib, Dabka
or Talh have managed to spring up, but they are so scattered that
they do not count. The papyrus and reeds, instead of dying a
natural death and forming soil by decay, are burnt down, and what
of the ashes is not blown away by the wind is carried away by the
next flood. Were it not for these fires it is probable that trees
of the species mentioned above would spring out more abundantly,
and it would not be a difficult matter to define the banks of the
channel by plantations of these or other river-side trees, such as
are to be found in Ceylon, for example, lining the river,
<em>e.g.</em>, <i>Terminalis glabra</i>, <i>Vitex Leucoxylon</i>,
<i>Vateria acuminata</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Recent history of blocks and
sudd-cutting. (Various.)</span>In 1863, 1864, and 1868, heavy sudds
blocked the Bahr El Jebel, and in the first mentioned year they
extend to the north of Lake No.</p>

<p>In 1870, Sir Samuel Baker found the Bahr El Jebel closed with
sudd at its mouth in Lake No. He attempted to ascend the Bahr El
Zeraf but failed to reach the Upper Nile, and was obliged to
return.</p>

<p>In 1871 he ascended the Bahr El Zeraf, and eventually forced his
way into the main river near Shambe, literally lifting his boats
and steamer over the intervening swamps and shallows.</p>

<p>In 1872 both the Bahr El Jebel and Bahr El Zeraf were closed,
and in 1874 Ismail Pasha Ayub cleared away the sudd in the former
river.</p>

<p>In 1878 Emin Pasha found it impossible to ascend the Bahr El
Jebel from the south.</p>

<p>In 1879 and 1880 Marno (an Austrian) cleared the Bahr El Jebel
of obstruction, completing his work in April, 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>In this same
year Gessi Pasha undertook his disastrous journey in the Bahr El
Ghazal, his steamer being blocked in that river for many weeks, and
his expedition only being extricated by the timely arrival of
another steamer under Marno, not, however, before he had lost many
men.</p>

<p>In 1881 and 1884 the Bahr El Jebel was again closed by the sudd.
During the period of Dervish rule nothing detailed was known
regarding the state of the river, but in 1895 it was reported to
the Intelligence Department that the White Nile was closed by the
sudd. During this period the steamer âMansurahâ sank in the main
channel in what is now known as the 15th block. The steamer was
discovered during the Sudd operations of 1903-04.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after the battle of Omdurman (2nd September,
1898) steamers were sent up-stream to investigate. Major M. Peake
attempted (7th October, 1898) to penetrate the Bahr El Jebel, but
in vain. He steamed, however, up the Bahr El Ghazal nearly as far
as Meshra el Rek. With Major Stanton he shortly afterwards steamed
157 miles up the Bahr El Zeraf, and was then stopped by shallow
water.</p>

<p>In the following year, after a visit by Sir W. Garstin and
Lt.-Col. Sparkes in the spring, operations for clearing the Bahr El
Jebel were seriously undertaken, and Major Peake left Omdurman at
the head of an expedition on 16th December, 1899. The party
consisted of five gunboats, five English and some Egyptian
officers, some British N.C.O.âs, 100 Sudanese, and a gang of 800
Dervish prisoners.</p>

<p>By the 27th March 1900, by means of hard and continuous labour,
14 blocks had been cleared out of 19, opening up 82 miles of river.
Major Peake then avoided the remaining blocks by using side
channels, arrived at Shambe, 25th April, 1900, and proceeded in
clear water to Rejaf (5th May, 1900). Four (16th to 19th) out of
the remaining five blocks were cleared by Lieutenant Drury, R.N.,
in January, 1901, and only the last one, the 15th, 22 miles long,
and just south of Hellet El Nuer, still remained. It was
considered, however, desirable to make renewed efforts to clear
this block. Accordingly an expedition under the direction of Major
G. E. Matthews was sent up in the winter of 1901-02, but did not
succeed in completely opening the channel. The work of clearing
this block was vastly increased owing to the entire absence of
current. Nothing was done in 1902-03, but in 1903-04 Lieutenant
Drury, late R.N., was again sent to renew the clearing operations.
Practically no traces of Major Matthewsâ work were discernible, and
when, after dogged perseverance, the accomplishment of the task was
well in sight the work had to be again reluctantly abandoned.</p>

<p>The false channel now in use is still liable to slight
sudd-blocks, especially from April to June. A monthly steamer and
other craft, however, keep the fairway open, as a ride, merely by
their passage, and there is little or no danger of the channel
being seriously blocked again.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Method of clearing.</span>The following
was the method employed by Major Peake in clearing the sudd:â</p>

<p>The first operation was to cut and burn the whole of the
vegetation growing on the surface; this was done by a party of men
with swords, fasses,<a id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and axes. Immediately
this was done the line to be taken up for the first channel,
generally about 12 yards in length, was marked out; this was
trenched by the Dervish prisoners armed with fasses, picks, axes
and saws, into pieces 4 yards square. After cutting down about 1
foot from the surface the water infiltrated; the men continued
cutting until, owing to the depth of the water, they were unable to
get any deeper. Holdfasts of telegraph poles were then driven as
far as they would go around the edge of each piece. After this a 1Â½
inch flexible steel wire hawser was sunk as deep as it would go by
means of the pronged poles, all round the piece to be removed; the
ends of it were made fast to the bullards in the bow of the
gunboat, one on the starboard side and one on the port, leaving
sufficient slack wire to allow the steamer to go astern some 20 to
30 yards before she got the strain; âfull speed asternâ was then
ordered. Full speed was kept up continually if the piece showed any
sign of becoming detached until it came gradually away; as soon as
the piece was quite clear, one end of the hawser was cast off and
the piece was allowed to float down the stream; the holdfasts were
pulled out by means of a rope, one end of which was made fast to
the bow of the steamer, and the other by a hitch to the end of the
holdfast. If the piece showed no signs of coming away, the engines
were reversed and the steamer was brought close up to the sudd and
then went astern again. This was repeated again and again until the
piece was detached. Some pieces were known to take as much as two
hours to get away. Sometimes with very thin sudd, after it had been
trenched, the steamer would be run up with her bow on to the sudd,
and on going astern would carry the piece with her; also with light
sudd a grapnel anchor fixed to the steamer when going astern was
found sufficient to tear away the piece.</p>

<p>Very often the sudd will be found with its roots adhering to the
bottom; this is especially the case in a year when there is a very
low Nile, like 1899-1900, or close up to the banks, when the first
leading channel is being widened.</p>

<p>In this case a grapnel or ordinary anchor sunk to the bottom of
the river and then dragged along by the steamer is useful. As soon
as the leading steamer has opened up the channel a sufficient
length to enable her not to interfere with a steamer working behind
her, another steamer is put to work, the same way as the first, to
widen the channel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
This is generally laborious work, as there is not much current to
act on the sudd, and in consequence it takes longer to get it
away.</p>

<p>In cutting the trenches care should be taken to cut or saw
through all roots.</p>

<p class="sch">ZOOLOGY OF THE SUDAN.</p>

<p class="center space-above15">ZOOLOGY.</p>

<p>In preparing the following notes on the Zoology of the country,
it has been assumed that the Mammals and Birds will present the
most general interest. The variety and distribution of the large
âgameâ animals has been briefly sketched, and, to make space for
this, reference to the Invertebrate animals has been omitted.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Mammals</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Primates.</em></span>Apes and Monkeys
are well represented in the Sudan. The Chimpanzee
(<i>Anthropopithecus troglodytes schweinfurthi</i>) occurs in the
Bahr el Ghazal region, where also is found the beautiful black and
white fur-bearing <i>Colobus guereza</i>; Baboons (<i>Papio
hamadryas</i> and <i>P. anubis</i>), Grivet (<i>Cercopithecus
sabÃ¦us</i>) and Patas Monkeys (<i>C. patas</i>) abound and are
widely distributed. Lemurs (<i>Galago</i>) occur, but are seldom
met with.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Carnivora.</em></span>The Lion is
found wherever the country is suited to its habits, and is in
places plentiful. In 1880, one was seen half-way between Berber and
Suakin, but at the present time it ranges little further north in
the Sudan than Kassala. The Leopard, commoner than the Lion, but
warier and less often seen, is even more widely distributed; the
Cheetah or Hunting Leopard (<i>CynÃ¦lurus jubatus</i>) less so.
Among smaller felines are the Serval, Caracal and Libyan Cat
(<i>Felis serval</i>, <i>F. caracal</i> and <i>F. libyca</i>).</p>

<p>HyÃ¦nas, spotted and striped (<i>H. crocuta</i> and <i>H.
striata</i>) are common; much rarer and more local is the
HyÃ¦na-like, but smaller, Aard Wolf (<i>Proteles cristatus</i>).</p>

<p>Jackals, Foxes and Fennecs are abundant; the Wild Dog (<i>Lycaon
pictus</i>) is scarcer.</p>

<p>Smaller carnivora are Civets, Genets, the Mongoose, the Ratel,
and the pretty little black-and-white Zorillas, which in coloration
remind one of the American Skunks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Insectivora.</em></span>The
<em>Insectivora</em> are represented by Hedgehogs and Shrews
(<i>Erinaceus</i> and <i>Crocidura</i>).</p>

<p>Bats (<em>Chiroptera</em>) are plentiful.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Rodentia.</em></span>Rodents
(<em>Rodentia</em>) are represented by the common Porcupine, Hares,
Ground-Squirrels (<i>Xerus</i>), Rats, and the Jerboas and
Gerbillesâcurious little nocturnal creatures living in holes in the
desert sands. They have long hind legs and tails, progress by leaps
like miniature kangaroos, are of a protective sandy coloration, and
subsist entirely without water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Ungulata.</em></span>Much the most
interesting to the general traveller and sportsman are the
<em>Ungulata</em> or hoofed animals, and in this âbig gameâ the
Sudan is particularly rich.</p>

<p>The Elephant is found on the Setit (from which during the Kharif
or rainy season it ranges as far north as the Gash), the Upper
Atbara, the Rahad, the Dinder, and the Blue Nile; it ranges across
the Gezira in smaller numbers and becomes more plentiful again
along the Upper Sobat, Pibor, the Bahr-el-Jebel, in the
Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, along and west of the Bahr-el-Arab as far
north as Kalaka. The ivory from these southern swampy districts is
much larger than that from the Blue Nile and Abyssinian
frontierâtusks running up to 130 lbs. or so in weightâbut it is not
of quite as good quality. No organized effort to capture and train
adult African elephants has been made in modern times, and attempts
to rear the young on cowâs or goatâs milk or farinaceous
substitutes have generally failed.</p>

<p>The Black Rhinoceros (<i>R. bicornis</i>) was found as far north
as the Gash in 1880; a very few still remain on the Setit, the
Rahad, Dinder and Blue Nile; on the Bahr-el-Jebel, in the
Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, and on the Bahr-el-Arab it is less scarce,
while there is some reason to believe that in this last-named tract
of country the White Rhinoceros (<i>R. Simus</i>) is not yet
extinct. The destruction of Rhinoceroses in the Sudan is absolutely
prohibited.</p>

<p>A curious little animal somewhat doubtfully placed by
naturalists near the Rhinoceroses is the <i>Hyrax</i>, a small
animal, in shape somewhat resembling a guinea-pig, which inhabits
rocky hills in many parts of the Sudan.</p>

<p>The Wild Ass is found in some of the Eastern deserts; while
Zebras (probably Grantâs Zebra) just extend into Sudan territory
north of Gondokoro on both banks of the Bahr El Jebel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Buffaloâthe
shorter-horned northern form (<i>Bos caffer equinoctialis</i>) are
numerous in suitable localities, and appear to be holding their
own; their distribution is roughly the same as that given for the
Elephant.</p>

<p>Of Hartebeests, <i>Bubalis tora</i> is common on the Setit, the
Upper Atbara and the Blue Nile tributaries; <i>Bubalis jacksoni</i>
takes its place on the White Nile, Bahr-el-Ghazal and in S.W.
Kordofan; a much scarcer and more local species, apparently
<i>Bubas Neumanni</i> has been found on the White Nile near J.
Ahmed Agha. The Tiang<a id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> or Bastard Hartebeest
(<i>Damaliscus tiang</i>) is abundant in the Gezira, and in the
southern and western parts of the Sudan; on the eastern side of the
country it does not range north of the Dinder.</p>

<p>The Water-buck (<i>Cobus defassa</i>) is generally distributed
where water and grazing are to be found; the beautiful Mrs. Grayâs
Water-buck (<i>C. maria</i>)âthe males of which are marked with a
snow-white patch on the withersâis one of the most local of African
Antelopes, inhabiting only the swamps of the Bahr-el-Ghazal and
Bahr-el-Jebel.</p>

<p>The White-eared Cob (<i>C. leucotis</i>), commencing near Renk,
follows the White Nile upwards, increasing in abundance in the
Bahr-el-Ghazal, occurring also on the Sobat and the Pibor, and
extending along the Bahr-el-Jebel into Uganda. On this last river
the Uganda Cob (<i>C. thomasi</i>) has been shot.</p>

<p>The Roan Antelope (<i>Hippotragus equinus bakeri</i>) is locally
distributed from the Setit to the south-west of the Sudan; the Blue
Nile tributaries are perhaps the chief stronghold of this noble
beast.</p>

<p>The <i>Oryx leucoryx</i> is plentiful in Western Kordofan; the
<i>Oryx beisa</i> occurs in one or two localities east of the
Atbara. The Addax ranges into the deserts of the Western Sudan, but
very few have yet been shot by any European.</p>

<p>The greater Kudu (<i>Strepsiceros capensis</i>) is one of the
scarcer Antelopes in the Sudan, occurring locally in Kordofan, and
from the Blue Nile to the neighbourhood of Suakin.</p>

<p>The largest known form of Eland (the <i>Taurotragus oryx
gigas</i> of Von Heuglin) is found in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
Province.</p>

<p>The Lesser Reedbuck (<i>Cervicapra bohor</i>) occurs on both the
Blue and White Niles and their tributaries, the Blue Nile examples
carrying the finest heads. The Bushbuck of the White Nile is
<i>Tragelaphus scriptus</i>, the Blue Nile form being <i>T.
decula</i>.</p>

<p>The commonest Gazelles of the Sudan are the Ariel, the
Red-fronted, the Dorcas, and Isabelline Gazelles (<i>Gazella
sÅmmeringi</i>, <i>G. rufifrons</i>, <i>G. dorcas</i>, and <i>G.
isabella</i>), widely distributed; more local are the Addra
Gazelle<a id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class=
"fnanchor">[234]</a> of Kordofan (<i>G. ruficollis</i>) and
Heuglinâs Gazelle of the Setit (<i>G. ptilonura</i>). Smaller
common Antelopes are the Duiker, Dig-dig, and Oribi
(<i>Cephalophus</i>, <i>Madoqua</i>, and <i>Ourebia</i>).</p>

<p>The Klipspringer (<i>Oreotragus saltator</i>) is found sparingly
on the hills of the Red Sea Littoral.</p>

<p>Ibex (<i>Capra nubiana</i>) frequent the rocky hills of the
Kassala and Suakin districts; Wild Sheep (<i>Ovis lervia</i>) have
a wider range, but are much scarcer and shier, and have not been
recently shot in the Sudan.</p>

<p>Giraffes are in parts numerous, their range in the Sudan area
being approximately that of the Elephant, except that they are
absent from localities which are entirely swampy.</p>

<p>A few Hippopotami still remain as far north as Dongola, and a
few are to be found near Khartoum. Up the White Nile and the
Bahr-el-Ghazal they abound, to such an extent that in places they
become dangerous or a positive nuisance.</p>

<p>Wart-hogs (<i>PhacochÃ¦rus</i>) are common and widely spread;
while the Sennar Boar (<i>Sus sennarensis</i>) has only been
obtained, and very rarely, in this one district.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Edentata.</em></span>A scaly
ant-eater (<i>Manis</i>) occurs, and also a curious ant-bear
(<i>Orycteropus Ã¦thiopicus</i>), very similar to the âAard Vaarkâ
of the Cape.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><em>Cetacea.</em></span>No Cetaceans have
been found in the Sudan rivers.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Birds</span>.</h3>

<p>The Bird fauna of the Sudan is rich and interesting. Visitors
will be most struck by the aquatic species whose abundance on the
rivers forms one of the most pleasing features of the scenery. The
practice of shooting at birds from steamers (forbidden by law, as
is all trading in plumes) cannot be too strongly deprecated. This
practice has within the last 30 years banished most of the
bird-life from the Egyptian parts of the Nile for ever.</p>

<p>Most of the birds, which are summer visitors to Europe, winter
in the Sudan, or pass through it on their way further south.
Conspicuous among these winter visitors are Hoopoes, Golden
Orioles, Bee-eaters, Shrikes, Warblers, Wagtails, Flycatchers,
&amp;c. Small resident species are abundant, the various kinds of
Weaver-finches predominating in numbers and collecting in vast
flights. Among this family the beautiful scarlet and black
âDura-birdâ (<i>Pyromelana franciscana</i>) and the long-tailed
Whydah Bird (<i>Steganura paradisea</i>) are specially noticeable.
The handsome Glossy Starlingsâcharacteristic African birdsâare
represented by the genera <i>Spreo</i>, <i>Lamprocolius</i>,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
<i>Lamprotornis</i>. Several species of Nightjars occur, noteworthy
among which is the remarkable Standard-Wing (<i>Macrodipteryx</i>),
bearing a large racket-shaped web at the end of an elongated
wire-like feather in each wing.</p>

<p>Colies, or âMouse-birds,â Kingfishers, Hornbills (chief among
which is the great black-and-white <i>Bucorax abyssinicus</i>),
Bee-eaters, Rollers and Cuckoos are well represented, as also are
Larks and Wheatears. Shining little Sun-birds frequent the forests
and enter the gardens in the towns.</p>

<p>Green parrakeets are common, and the grey parrot may be found on
the Uganda boundary.</p>

<p>Of birds of prey there are Vultures, Eagles, Falcons, Ospreys,
Harriers, Buzzards, Hawks, and Owls in great varietyâamong which
may be mentioned the Noisy River Eagle (<i>Haliaetus vocifer</i>),
the Secretary Bird (<i>Serpentarius secretarius</i>), and the
handsome Bateleur Eagle (<i>Helotarsus ecaudatus</i>).</p>

<p>The rivers abound with Pelicans, Cormorants, Darters, Herons,
Egrets, Bitterns, Storks, Ibises, and Spoonbills. Among these the
great carrion-feeding Adjutant or Marabou (<i>Leptoptilus
crumeniferus</i>) is conspicuous. The remarkable and very local
Whale-headed Stork (<i>BalÃ¦niceps rex</i>) is found in the swamps
of the Bahr-el-Ghazal and Bahr-el-Jebel, while the stately
Saddle-billed Stork (<i>Ephippiorhynchus
senegalensis</i>)âiridescent black and white with long
brilliantly-coloured billâis more widely met with. Flamingoes are
scarce; Spur-winged and Egyptian Geese, and Whistling Teal,
resident and plentiful. Their numbers are swelled by large hosts of
northern-breeding ducks, which arrive in the autumn and remain till
the spring. Vast numbers of Plovers, Godwits, Whimbrels,
Sandpipers, and Terns also winter on the Nile. Snipe occur, but in
comparatively small numbers, the area of irrigated land being very
limited, and the grasses of the Nile swamps being too high and
thick for them.</p>

</div>

<p>Three species of Sandgrouse are very abundant; the commonest
(<i>Pterocles exustus</i>) affords the best bird shooting in the
countryâin the dry season they daily flight in thousands from the
deserts to drink at the rivers. Doves and Guinea-fowl swarm in most
parts; Francolins are more local and less plentiful. Quail are also
found in parts.</p>

<p>A large Bustard (<i>Eupodotis arabis</i>) is plentiful and gives
pretty rifle shooting. Three or four smaller bustards also
occur.</p>

<p>The strikingly-beautiful Crowned Crane (<i>Balearica
pavonina</i>) is resident and common, and in the winter immense
flights of Common Cranes (<i>Grus grus</i>) and smaller numbers of
the Demoiselle (<i>Grus virgo</i>) spread over the country.</p>

<p>The Ostrich is generally distributed, but is most abundant in
Western Kordofan.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Reptiles</span>.</h3>

<p>The common African Crocodile (<i>Crocodilus niloticus</i>)
abounds in the Sudan rivers. Large Monitor Lizards or âWaranas,â
reaching 5 or 6 feet in length, are not uncommon: among smaller
lizards are various Chameleons, Geckoes, and Skinks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>Soft-backed
river Turtles (<i>Trionyx</i>) are plentiful. A common land
Tortoise is <i>Testudo calcarata</i>: a common aquatic Tortoise is
<i>SternothÃ¦rus adansoni</i>.</p>

<p>Of snakes the largest is <i>Python sebÃ¦</i>; of poisonous
species the Cobra, the Horned Cerastes, and, further south, the
Puff-Adder occur: harmless species are more numerous. On the whole,
snakes in the Sudan are not plentiful enough to be troublesome, and
the mortality due to snake-bite seems insignificant.</p>

<p>Batrachians are rather poorly represented: a Toad (<i>Bufo
regularis</i>) very like the common European species is the most
abundant.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Fish</span>.</h3>

<p>The Nile fish have recently been very thoroughly investigated,
the collection formed by Mr. Loat, under the auspices of the
Egyptian Government, being the largest ever brought together from
one country.</p>

<p>Those interested in the subject may note that the scientific
results of the âfish surveyâ will shortly be published in the form
of a Monograph, by Mr. G. A. Boulenger.</p>

<p>[Briefly speaking, it may be said that the rivers swarm, almost
throughout, with fish; they are mostly of a coarse kind, some
running to an immense sizeâ40 to 50 lbs. being quite an ordinary
weight for some species.â<span class="sc">Note by

<p class="sch">THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE SUDAN.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Vide</em> also <a href="#Page_221">pp.
221-228.</a>)</p>

<p>The three decades following the Egyptian conquest of the Sudan
in 1819 were each marked by the appearance of a large work dealing
with the antiquities of the newly-opened provinces. Unfortunately
the authors of these works, Cailliaud, Hoskins, and Lepsius, have
found no successors of equal means and perseverance, so that our
knowledge of the actual remains stands about as Lepsius left it.
When Cailliaud (1820) and Hoskins (1833) visited the Sudan, nothing
certain was known of the ancient relations of Egypt and Ethiopia,
and the wildest philological theories were in the air. The imposing
monuments which these travellers found fitted the theories that
Egyptian art was the oldest art known; Ethiopia was supposed by
some to be the mother of Egypt; here, then, at Meroe, Hoskins
fancied that he had found the cradle, not of Egypt only but of the
whole civilised world. Criticism began with Lepsius (1842): the
style of these remains convinced him that they were not the archaic
parents of Egyptian art but the late offspring of a mÃ©salliance
between Egypt and the luxuriant South. The progress made since his
day enables us to recognise more clearly the main lines of
development, though it will require years of research to fill in
the details of our picture.</p>

<p>In the following notes the antiquities are grouped for
convenience into four divisionsâthe Prehistoric, the Egyptian, the
Meroitic, and the Christian.</p>

<p>1. <em>Prehistoric.</em>âWe know now that the dynastic culture
of Egypt was developed at Abydos, Memphis and elsewhere, long
before it reached the Sudan, but from the very earliest days desire
for the products of the south must have attracted the trader and
the soldier, and so carried the culture of Egypt ever further to
the south. The ivory and the skulls found in pre-dynastic Egyptian
tombs, and the dwarfs and black troops referred to in the
Historical Summary, are sporadic witnesses to a coming and going
along the Nile Valley which must have lasted for tens of thousands
of years. What and whom the early travellers found we cannot say:
the country was probably partitioned among a number of petty
princelets like the Meleks whom Burckhardt describes as reigning in
the provinces of Dongola and Berber in the eighteenth century, and
some of the old forts reported in this region and in the desert may
date back to this period. To this epoch possibly belong also some
of the groups of tumuli visible between the 4th and the 6th
cataracts and elsewhere, but of them only one,<a id=
"FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class=
"fnanchor">[235]</a> of the Bronze Age, has been hitherto
excavated. A closer study of the surface will doubtless bring to
light vestiges of the Stone Age, as it has already done in Egypt
and Somaliland.</p>

<p>2. <em>Egyptian.</em>âThe first effective occupation of the
northern parts of the Sudan dates from the Middle Empire, but
though it is represented by several monuments noted in the list
below, it did not last for long. The kings and queens of the New
Empire returned to the conquest and exploration of the south, and
left much more striking memorials of their greatness. The tablets
found at Tel el Amarna are full of requests from Syrian princes for
gold, which was exported to them unworked, and by them smelted and
wrought into ornaments and vessels. Now the bulk of this gold came
from the numerous mines which still exist between the Red Sea and
the Nile; in a word the Northern Sudan was the âRandâ of the
ancient world. The shafts and huts of the miners, their
washing-tables, grinders, and other appliances are found still
<em>in situ</em>, and the position of some of the finest temples is
now seen to be determined by their nearness to rich auriferous
regions. This is, perhaps, the most important discovery made since
the days of Lepsius.</p>

<p>Under the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties the Northern Sudan
was an Egyptian province, an appanage often of the heir-apparent,
and the monuments of this date (see below) are thoroughly Egyptian
in character. Under the twenty-second dynasty the conditions were
reversed and Egypt became an Ethiopian province; but, as is usual,
the civilised power conquered its conqueror, and although Napata
now reached its zenith, the character of buildings, statuary, and
inscriptions, was not native but Egyptian; this was only natural,
seeing that the Ethiopians could command the best workmen in Egypt.
It is not until the sixth century <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
that we begin to see signs of a change. The inscriptions
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> Heru-Sa-Atef and
Nastasenen clearly betray the native origin of their authors; they
were written in hieroglyphics by priests who aimed in vain at
reproducing the old classical idiom of Thebes. Their last editor
very aptly compares them to attempts of a Dongolawi to write
Koranic Arabic.</p>

<p>3. <em>Meroitic.</em>âWith the conquests of Alexander and his
successors and the spread of the Roman Empire, Ethiopia was brought
into touch with a wider system than any it had yet seen, and this
Greco-Roman period coincides with the development of a complex
original style, in which the African character seems to find its
first articulate expression. Exact dates for the numerous monuments
in this style cannot be given; some may go back before the time of
Alexander, some of the most elaborate certainly fall late in the
Roman period. The architectural forms of the latter show the
gradual supersession of Egyptian conventions by European designs
and construction, while the rich attire of the rulers portrayed
bears witness not less to their barbaric taste than to the wealth
which radiated under the <em>Pax Romana</em> even beyond the limits
of the empire. In this mingling of East and West these works should
be compared with those of other schools that arose under the shadow
of the Roman Empire, such as the Palmyrene school in Syria and the
Greco-Roman Buddhist school in the north-west of India.</p>

<p>The most characteristic works of this school are to be found in
the Berber province. The pyramids (Bagarawiya) and the avenue of
rams and the pylon-fronted temples (Nagaa and Wadi El Sufra) point
back to Egyptian prototypes, but side by side with these we see
temples where the pylons have given way to columns fluted and
spaced in the fashion of a Roman peristyle shrine, and one small
building which has even been described as a Christian basilica!</p>

<p>The Meroitic Pantheon is equally mixed: we pass from the Ammon
of Thebes to the Ammon of Napata, and from him to a strange
Ethiopian Serapis and a still stranger local or Indian lion-headed
god.</p>

<p>The subjects are mostly, like those in Egypt, scenes of
adoration or offerings of spoils of victory, but the persons
sculptured are Egyptian neither in type nor costume. The best-known
of these is the fat Queen âCandace,â whose very fleshly charms are
set off by masses of jewellery, heavy necklaces, armlets,
bracelets, sandals, and clinging feather-like garments. Her
consorts and attendants are only less richly bedizened with jewels
and rare stuffs, embroidered with crosses, crescents, âand other
delights.â Other panels represent water goddesses and hunting
scenes with wild beasts (lions, elephants, etc.), led in captivity
by men and genii. The small objects found on these sites (now
mostly at Munich and Berlin) give the same impression of barbaric
wealth, and the relatively numerous bells show that the Ethiopian
of those days was as fond of noise as his black successor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the inscriptions which accompany these buildings
cannot be deciphered. As we saw above, Egyptian was a foreign
language to the people of Napata in the sixth century. On the
Meroitic monuments not only is the language foreign, but new
phonetic values have been given to the old hieroglyphic signs,
which makes even transliteration impossible until more bilingual
inscriptions turn up.<a id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> And these hieroglyphics
persist until superseded by a script based on Egyptian demotic or
perhaps some Arabian alphabet, which is equally unintelligible.</p>

<p>4. <em>Christian.</em>âThe Christian antiquities have fared
still worse at the hands of explorers than the earlier ones; the
traveller notes âruins of a Coptic conventâ and hurries on to
something more congenial. Lepsius collected a few inscriptions, and
these have been supplemented from time to time; a few things have
been found at Soba and rough sketches published of one or two
churches.</p>

<p>The most interesting building known to the writer is the church
at Old Dongola, a building in two storeys of burnt bricks,
subsequently encased in a thick shell of sun-dried bricks. The
ground plan of this is believed to be unique: it looks like an
adaptation to Christian ends of old Egyptian structural motives.
This building and the ruin-heaps into which many other
churchesâstill called Kanisas by the nativesâhave been reduced,
show that all the lessons of construction learnt under the Roman
Empire were not forgotten under the rule of the Christian kings.
The pottery of this period was, so far as one can judge from
fragments still lying on the surface, more finely levigated, better
baked, and more variously decorated than in earlier or later
days.</p>

<p>Inscriptions in three languages have been found. At Soba, and
perhaps at Geteina (White Nile), Christian inscriptions occur in an
unknown language, but in the Greek alphabet eked out by five
additional letters; from the Dongola province and from Northern
Nubia come inscriptions in Greek and in Coptic. Some of these are
dated in the eighth and ninth centuries <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span>, and the formulÃ¦ used in them are similar to
those found in Egypt.</p>

<p>The list of ancient sites, etc., appended does not pretend to be
complete. Those who wish for further information are referred to
the following authorities, which may be supplemented from the

antiquities is still in its infancy.</p>

<h3><em>Antiquities on or near the Nile Banks.</em>
</h3>

<p>About 2 miles above Halfa, on the west bank, is an ancient
Egyptian site with several temples.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abu Sir.</span>Five and a half miles
above the same town, on the west bank, is the rock of Abu Sir. The
chief historical interest of this spot (from which a fine view of
the 2nd Cataract is obtained) is the variety of names inscribed on
it, reaching back several hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Matuka. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2760? or 2430?</span>Three miles south of Abu Sir are remains of
the fortress and small temple of Matuka, built by Usertsen I of the
Twelfth Dynasty.</p>

<p>On a large island opposite are the remains of a similar fortress
and on another small island to the south are the ruins of a Coptic
church called Darbe (M. 983)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Semna and Kumma. <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 2320? <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1600?
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2300.</span>Forty-three miles south
of Halfa are the fortress temples of Semna and Kumma, built by
Usertsen III. Rebuilt and extended by Thothmes III of the
Eighteenth Dynasty. In good preservation. Amenemhat III also marked
the rise of the Nile here (B.N. 489, 490; B.E. iii, 46, 48, etc.,
iv, 94, vi, 187, and <em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_222">p.
222</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Amara. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1000?</span>At Amara are important ruins of a temple with
sculptured columns (L.; B.N. 491).</p>

<p>At Selima Oasis, 55 miles west of Sagiet El Abd, are remains of
old convents, built out of still older remains, on which there are
unknown inscriptions. (<em>Vide</em> <a href="#Page_203">p.
203.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sai. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1660-1600?</span>At Sai Island, 130 miles from Halfa, are remains
of a town and Coptic church, and of cemeteries, also of a temple
with inscriptions of Thothmes III and Amenhotep I (Eighteenth
Dynasty).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sedinga. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1800.</span>At Sedinga, 6 miles further, are the ruins of a fine
temple by Amenhotep III, a column and a cemetery (B.E. iv,
111).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">J. Dush. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1620?</span>Six miles to the south is Jebel Dush, with a tomb
contemporary with Thothmes III (B.N. 402).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Solib. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1500.</span>A mile further on is Solib, with the well-preserved
remains of a magnificent temple by Amenophis III (L.; B.N. 492;
B.E. iv, 59, etc.; Hoskins, etc.). Many treasures removed to Jebel
Barkal.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sesebi. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1370 or 1275?</span>Sesebi, opposite Dalgo, contains a ruined
temple by Seti I, father of Rameses the Great. (L.; B.E. v, 9.)</p>

<p>In the district between Dalgo and Koya are several ancient
workings for gold and copper, which account for the presence of
rich temples near.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tombos.</span>On the Island of Tombos,
near Kerma, are granite quarries and one statue unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Argo.</span>On the Island of Argo (Arkaw)
are ruins of a temple and of two granite statues lying on the
ground (about 24 feet long, including pedestal), of Sebekhotep III,
of the Thirteenth Dynasty, or else, more probably, of the Napata
period.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Karman.</span>Near Argo, on the right
bank at Karman are the ruins of a large town, and two large
mud-brick tombs (B.N. 493, and L.), called Dafufa and Karman.</p>

<p>Six or seven miles south of New Dongola, on the right bank at a
place named Kawa, is a delicate little Egyptian temple, date
unknown, in good preservation. (Discovered and partially excavated
by Colonel Hon. J. Colborne, 1885.)</p>

<p>Khandak marks the site of an ancient Egyptian town of which
traces may be seen in the citadel.</p>

<p>South of Khandak are traces of Christian or older sites at Firgi
and Khalewa on the west bank (Greek inscriptions have come from the
latter), and on the east bank at Amentogo, Arab Hag (inscription
from obelisk set up in Napata (?) by Piankhi) and a few miles east
of Meganda, the last two in the Latte.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Old Dongola.</span>Old Dongola, now
almost deserted, was the capital of the Christian kingdom of
Dongola in the sixth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>The upper floor
of the fine church there is now used as a mosque. On a ridge
between the church and the river are remains of ancient
fortification. An obelisk of Piankhi, now at Cairo, the fellow to
that at Arab Hag, was found here, but had been probably carried
from Jebel Barkal. Some Christian inscriptions have been found here
(<em>see</em> âJournal of Theological Studies,â IV, p. 583).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Kurru, Zuma, Tangasi.</span>At Kurru and
Zuma (east bank), and Tangasi, 7 to 10 miles from Merowe, are
remains of large groups of pyramids (B.N. 496), a few of stone,
others of mud-brick from which the stone casing has been
removed.</p>

<p>On Gimeti Island are traces of a church.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Merowe. <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 900
to <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 200.</span>Merowe (north bank) and
Abu Dom Sanam (south bank) mark the site of Napata (Nept or
Nepita). The old city appears to have been on the south bank, and
of considerable size (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_222">p.
222</a>). A few miles from the river on this bank, in low hills,
are the remains of a number of rock-hewn tombs, and 3 or 4 miles
up-stream from Abu Dom, on the north bank, lie the pyramids and
ruins of the temples of Napata.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Jebel Barkal.</span>Jebel Barkal, 302
feet high, the âHoly Mountainâ of the inscriptions, can be seen for
many miles round; on the plain by the side of the hill are ruins of
eight or nine pyramids, and on the rising ground are eight more,
varying from 20 to 60 feet in height.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Circa <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 700.
Nuri.</span>The principal temples are those of Taharka and Piankhi,
close to Jebel Barkal. At Nuri, 7Â½ miles from Merowe, on the south
bank, are the remains of 35 pyramids, solidly built, and probably
of the Middle (?) Empire. At Wadi Ghazal are the remains of a fine
Christian monastery. (B.N. 496-503; Cailliaud; Lepsius.)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Belal.</span>A few miles beyond Belal
(foot of the 4th Cataract) and on the south bank are the remains of
a Coptic church and fortified monastery.</p>

<p>Opposite Hamdab Island, 6 miles further on, are the ruins of a
pyramid.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Berber.</span>No further remains have
been discovered for the next 250 miles or more. There is evidence
that Berber was in the ancient days a starting point, as now, for
caravans for Suakin, but there are no ancient remains, as far as is
known.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of Meroe and Bagarawiya.
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 400 to <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
250.</span>On crossing the Atbara the âIsland of Meroeâ is entered,
and at Bagarawiya, some 45 miles south of the Atbara, three
important groups of pyramids, about 100 in all, are reached. These,
also called the pyramids of Assur, lie about 3 miles from the
river, and are the tombs of kings and princes of the old capital,
which lay somewhere near Shendi. An important find of jewellery of
the Roman period was made here by Signor Ferlini, an Italian
doctor, in 1834. (B.N. 509-513; L.; Cailliaud; Ferlini; W.) Since
then the tops of many pyramids have been damaged in similar
searches.</p>

<p>About 29 miles south of Shendi, on the east bank, is the
entrance to the Wadi Ban Nagaa, and near it is a village of that
name. Three miles down the river are the ruins of a small ancient
Nubian temple.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nagaa.</span>Twenty-three miles
south-east from the railway station of Wadi Ban Nagaa, and situated
in a low waterless desert, are the extensive remains of an ancient
town. The walls of six temples are still standing, at least in
part, and the foundations of several others can be traced. Two of
them are connected together by an avenue of rams. One of the
temples is almost purely Roman in style, and belongs, perhaps, to
the third century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>; others are
transitional; these are in comparatively excellent preservation.
(Description by Rev. L. Gwynne; B.N. 514, 515; Cailliaud
[elaborate]; and W.). They were also visited by Wurt (1811),
Demetrio (1822), Holroyd (1837), and Lepsius.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">El Sufra.</span>Twelve miles north-east
of Nagaa are the ruins of El Sufra, also called El Masurat, a group
of buildings within walls, of the Roman period, with a Meroitic
inscription (C.; L.; and Hoskins, and B.N. pp. 515-516). One and
a-half miles off are some Christian temples (?) (B.N. p. 515). A
road track leads south-east from Shendi <em>viÃ¢</em> Nagaa temples
to Soba, and there are, it is reported, old temples on the way.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Khartoum.</span>There are no visible
ruins of ancient temples at Khartoum, though it is known that it
was the site of a large town (<em>vide</em> <a href="#Page_228">p.
228</a>). A colossal Christian (?) stone lamb has been brought here
from Soba (W.).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Soba.</span>At Soba, believed to be the
old capital of the Christian Kingdom of Alwa, built on the old
Ethiopic site of âSobas,â 13 miles from Khartoum and on the east
bank of the Blue Nile, are some remains of granite pillars and of a
Christian church, including a decorated base with a large cross
carved on it (W.). Little is known about this. There is said to
have been a bridge here over the Blue Nile.</p>

<h3><em>Miscellaneous.</em>

El Fura are the remains of a large rectangular fort (about 60 by 50
yards), with massive stone walls some six feet high and eight to
ten feet thick, with curious square projections, perhaps for
flanking defence. It may belong to the same period as the great
stone fortifications at Old Dongola and Khandak, but the masonry
presents one curious feature not observed there, namely, the

36Â° 40â³, N. Lat. 20Â°). The ground plan of these tombs is octagonal;
they were roofed apparently by a dome supported on a hexagonal (?)
drum, and lit by plain rectangular windows. It is impossible to say
whether they belong to the late Christian or the early Mohammedan
period. The rounded battlement which crowns the corners of the
eight walls is a common feature on Sheikhsâ tombs.</p>

<p>It only remains to point out that the surface of Sudan
antiquities has barely been touched. It is hoped that as money
becomes available more of the ancient history of the Sudan may be
brought to light, and more particularly is it hoped that the
meaning of the Nubian and Meroitic hieroglyph inscriptions may
shortly be discovered.</p>

<p>The whole matter is being gradually taken up by the Sudan
Government, but want of funds hampers the work.</p>

<p class="sch">ETHNOLOGY OF THE SUDAN.</p>

<p>The wealth of the Nile Valley has at all times tempted invasion;
the land presents no serious physical obstacles, and the people who
live in the countries bordering it have always been unsettled and
migratory. We expect, therefore, to find here a perfect babel of
tongues and races. To mention invasions from the East alone and
within the historic period, Africa has been overrun by the dynastic
Egyptian, the Hyksos, the Abyssinians and the Arabs, and from the
early cemeteries of Abydos archÃ¦ologists have collected skulls
which appear to show that from the time of the Stone Age four races
at least have contributed to the population of Egypt. These races
Kollmann<a id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class=
"fnanchor">[237]</a> identifies as Punts, who were, perhaps, of
Semitic origin, Nubians, Libyans, and Negroes, the last including
several Pygmies and, to judge from their grave-offerings, some men
of wealth and consideration. In the Sudan no detailed researches
have been made in ancient burial-places, but we may confidently
expect some day to read in the northern half the same story as in
Egypt.</p>

<p>Invasion, moreover, is not the only disturbing element. The
natives of the Sudan, even when they have adopted a more or less
settled life, are great travellers: traffic in human flesh and
conquest for the sake of human flesh have nowhere been pursued so
long and so thoroughly. The native changes his abode without
hesitation, and his love of strange women is passing Solomonâs. A
hundred years ago Brown found Darfur full of Dongolawi traders.
Fifty years ago the same race had turned their eyes to Kordofan and
the Bahr El Ghazal, and wherever they go they intermarry with the
women of the land. The Takruris have similarly in a peaceable way
shifted their abode from Darfur to the province of Kassala within
quite recent days.</p>

<p>Yet again, in the southern half we have seen within the last few
centuries a succession of loosely-knit empires (Fungs, Shilluks,
etc.) which carry the name and often the language of a single tribe
over a wide area and then melt away, leaving behind only confusion
to the ethnologist. What we know to have existed for the last
thousand years, we can premise for the last fifty (?) thousand. So
intricately mixed indeed is this southern half that the Nileland
has been aptly described as the Negro <em>Potpourri</em>.</p>

<p>But there are mitigating circumstances which we must also take
into account, otherwise the ethnologist would indeed be, of all
men, the most hopeless.</p>

<p>In the first place, invaders do not exterminate and, by what
seems to be almost a law, the old Somatic types tend continually to
reassert themselves; a new invasion, that is, changes for a time
the numerical proportion of different types, but as the newcomers
are absorbed the old order returns, and the preponderating elements
in the population become increasingly evident. It is a commonplace
in Egypt that a Turk of the third generation is indistinguishable
from a native.</p>

<p>In the second place, invasions and migrations have gone on from
time immemorial, but they have always come from the same regions.
Kollmann, as we saw, makes a four-fold division of the prehistoric
inhabitants of Abydos; this corresponds to our four-fold division
into Semites, Nubians, Libyans, and Negroes. The successive inroads
into our area have meant, therefore, not the introduction of new
constituents but the stiffening of an element already present by a
fresh influx of kindred blood.</p>

<p>These two facts simplify the problem: they do not enable us to
say that so-and-so is an Arab, indeed they make it impossible to
say so with scientific certainty, but they will enable us
<em>ultimately</em> to say which original stock has contributed
most to the population of any given district. âUltimatelyâ because
at present the data which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_318">[318]</span> alone will permit us to delimit the
frontiers of the various peoples are wanting.<a id=
"FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class=
"fnanchor">[238]</a> Along the river, especially, one stock shades
into another with such delicate gradations that no two observers
seem to agree as to the point of division, and the theories of the
people themselves as to their own origin and that of their
neighboursâtheories which seldom agreeâhave little foundation in
fact, albeit to some they may prove of greater interest and
political importance than the future classifications of the
learned.</p>

<p>We must at present renounce all pretensions to scientific
exactitude and confine ourselves to more or less popular
distinctions; accordingly, eliminating from our survey all recent
new-comers of European or Asiatic extraction, we shall divide the
present inhabitants of the Sudan broadly into four groupsâthe
Negro, the Nuba, the Bega, the Arab.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">(i) Negroes.</span>The ancient Egyptians
referred to the Southâit is difficult to say where it beganâas the
land of the black man, just like their successors, who named it
Nigritia or Belad el Sudan; and they knew, as we know, that there
were pygmy blacks as well as big fighting blacks. Whether the
pygmies, relics of whom have been found all over the world, were
evolved first in Africa or came in as immigrants, and whether the
big blacks were developed by selection from them here or elsewhere
we cannot here discuss. Suffice it to say that from before the dawn
of history the two have always been in Africa, and that the Negroes
of the Nile land are to-day more hopelessly subdivided than the
Negroes of any other part. The pygmies have been now driven into
the forests of Central Africa, and the big Negroes are now found in
the Sudan only on the Upper reaches of the White and Blue Niles and
in the hill countries to the west; north of this they occur merely
as immigrants, soldiers, slaves, etc., amounting, though, in some
parts to almost 50 per cent. of the population. They vary
enormously in size, colour, language, institutions, and religion,
so that in spite of the great work of such explorers as
Schweinfurth, Emin, and Junker, we are still far from unravelling
the intricate web of their interrelations. A recent writer, who has
given a popular account of the researches of travellers before the
Mahdia, disclaims as impossible any attempt at scientific
classification, and we can only follow him in grouping the blacks
of the White Nile and its tributaries according to the picturesque
impression which they made upon their visitors. In this book (âDie
Heiden Neger des Aegyptischen Sudan,â Berlin, 1893), Frobenius
divides the blacks within our present frontiers into four
groups:â</p>

<table class="padded05" id="t318">
<tr>
<td class="tdr-top">I.</td>
<td class="tdl hang1">The Swamp NegroesâShilluk, Shuli, Bari, Jur,

<td class="tdl hang1">The Latuka.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For further information about these people we must refer the
reader to other chapters in this compendium, and to the authors
mentioned above.</p>

<p>It only remains to point out that the blacks of Kordofan and the
Blue Nile, offer practically virgin fields to the ethnologist.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">(ii) Nubas.</span>Under this head we
include (<em>a</em>) the Barabra, who are found between the 1st and
4th cataracts, and are subdivided into natives of Dongola, Mahas,
Sukkot, Halfa, each with a different dialect; (<em>b</em>) the
Nubas of Kordofan, with their sub-tribes. To these some
philologists add, on linguistic grounds, a number of tribes usually
described as negro or negroid.<a id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Geographically, and perhaps physically also, these Nubians
appear as a link between Egypt and Negro land. They are darker and
smaller than the Egyptian, but still brown and not black,<a id=
"FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class=
"fnanchor">[240]</a> although they often have, like so many
Egyptians, the woolly hair of the Negro. It is probable that they
represent the ancient Kushites, and the latest student of the old
Ethiopian inscriptions has sought to prove that the Nubians and not
the Begas were the rulers of ancient Napata.<a id=
"FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class=
"fnanchor">[241]</a> They are enterprising people, apt linguists
and great travellers, very ready to take on a veneer of European
culture, the last trait being an old one caricatured by the
wall-painters of ancient Thebes. It is the more strange that they
should have preserved their own dialects, especially as they have
been Muslims for some centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>It was on the
ground of their language that Lepsius<a id=
"FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class=
"fnanchor">[242]</a> related the Nilotic Nubians with the Nubawis
of Kordofan. The connection corresponds with traditions current in
Dongola, where the traveller will hear again and again that,
although the particular man he is interrogating is, of course, pure
Arab from the Hejaz, yet most of the people round are Nubians like
the Nubawis of Kordofan. Supposing this relationship to be proved,
it would be still uncertain whether the Kordofan people are a
colony from the Nilotes or <em>vice versÃ¢</em>. But it is also
possible that the Nubawis of Kordofan adopted a Nuba language in
some by-gone age when there was a powerful Christian or
pre-Christian Nubian kingdom on the Nile. If we are to believe
Hartmann<a id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class=
"fnanchor">[243]</a>âa very good observerâthe majority of the
Shaigia âArabiâ and many of the Jaalin really belong to the same
stock.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">(iii) Begas.</span>This name is derived
from medieval Arab historians and has been identified with the
BugatÃ¦ and Buka of earlier days. It is applied to the tribes living
in the eastern desert who speak various languages belonging to the
so-called Hamitic group of languages. The principal tribes are
Ababda, Bisharin, Amarar, Hadendoa, Halenga, Beni Amer, Habab.</p>

<p>In type they are far more âCaucasianâ than those we have
previously mentioned, and they occupy the same position and present
the same characteristics as many turbulent pastoral tribes
mentioned by Egyptian scribes and classical writers.<a id=
"FNanchor_242b"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class=
"fnanchor">[242]</a> As Hamites, one school of anthropologists
represented by the Italian Sergi, regards them as an off-shoot of
the great Euro-African stock which populated North Africa and
Europe: others bring them from Asia. âNon nostri est tantas
componere lites.â Nor do we like to hazard an opinion as to whether
they or the Nubians were the creators of ancient Meroe. The
termination <em>ab</em> which is so common throughout the Berber
Province proves that people of the Bega stock once held this
district, and their immediate descendants are probably to be looked
for among the riverain âArabsâ rather than the desert Begas, for no
civilized people would exchange a settled life for a nomad life,
least of all so warlike a race as the Begas.</p>

<p>According to W. Max MÃ¼ller (âAethiopien,â Berlin, 1904, p. 19),
we have in the legend quoted on <a href="#Page_224">p. 224,</a> a
distorted version of one Hamitic settlement in this very area. The
word Sembridae or Semberritae is a hybrid name formed by a North
Hamitic people out of a Semitic root, and means, not âDeserters,â
but âNomads,â âWanderers.â The legend above-mentioned will
therefore be the echo of an early Hamitic invasion of a district
then peopled by Nubas or Negroes, and of the adoption of a
sedentary life by these invading âWanderers,â whose success may
explain the shifting of the capital from Napata to Meroe (<a href=
"#Page_225">p. 225</a>).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">(iv) Arabs.</span>The first three stocks
have been in the country for as long as our records go. The Arabs
are comparative newcomers; it is improbable that they came in any
numbers until after the fall of the Christian kingdoms of Dongola
and Alwa (Soba). The traditions of some tribes are against this,
but historians only mention raids, and the traditions are not to be
set against the historiansâ testimony. The extension of these
raids, which led to the downfall of Christianity and a consequent
increase of Arab immigration, was probably due to pressure caused
on tribes elsewhere by the conquests of Spain and Portugal on the
one side and Turkey on the other. This would give the Arabs an
occupation of from four to six centuries, though a slow
infiltration from Arabia into the Sudan must have gone on from the
beginning.</p>

<p>Now, at any rate, the Arab dominates the northern half of the
Sudan, that is, from Egypt to Kordofan. He has nowhere exterminated
the original inhabitants; he has in many cases not yet succeeded in
forcing even his language upon them; he has, unlike the Arabs in
Arabia, intermarried freely with them; but his conquest has been so
far complete that his religious ideals and tribal organisation have
replaced the older faith and institutions wherever he has cared to
carry them. This fact upsets our perspective. The people call
themselves Arabs and we accept the name, but it would certainly be
a mistake to regard them as Arabians or to recognise as genuine
their long pedigrees âof unsullied (?) Arab descentâ âgoing back to
early Mohammedan timesâ (Keane). The present writer believes that
the materials newly published by Naum Bey Shoucair (âHistory of the
Sudan,â Cairo, 1904âin Arabic), enable him to trace two distinct
steps in the Arabization of the Central Sudan.</p>

<p>Up to 1500 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>, the Christians reigned
on the Blue Nile; there are no Gubbas, no mention of Fikis, earlier
than this, as would certainly have been the case if many Arabs had
been here. About this time the Fungs, a powerful black tribe under
Amara Dunkas, became Muslims and, assisted by some Arab immigrants,
overthrew the kingdom of Soba. Hardly had they done so when they
were themselves menaced by Sultan Selim, the Turkish conquerer of
Egypt and Suakin; it was their policy then to represent themselves
as orthodox Muslims connected with the most venerated Arab tribes,
and a certain Sheikh El Samarakandi, who had wandered to the court
of Dunkas, provided the necessary pedigrees, which were duly sent
to Selim and by him much admired (Naum II, pp. 73, 74). But the
Sheikh did his work clumsily, if it may be judged from a Jaali
pedigree which purports to be extracted<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_320">[320]</span> from his work, for he left at the crucial
point several non-Arabic names, and few, if any, Sudanese pedigrees
are accepted by Muslim genealogists elsewhere.</p>

<p>At this point the Arabization of Central Sudan seems to have
stood almost still for three centuries. Gubbas were built and Fikis
became powerful, but the tribal organization, although indigenous
among the Begas, did not supplant the very different political
division of the land into small kingdoms tributary to Sennar. The
emblems of kingly power, a throne called the K-K-R and a two-horned
cap (Naum II, pp. 100, 101), are also clearly African, not Arab.
Burkhardt, again, who knew the Arabs in Syria and Arabia, is never
tired of contrasting their manners and morals with those of the
Sudanese Arabs.</p>

<p>This period was closed by the Egyptian conquest of Mohammed Ali,
which continued the process begun in the time of Selim, and finally
obliterated several of the most characteristic survivals from
pre-Islamic days. Indeed, all the events of the last century,
including the great upheaval in which it culminated, had the same
tendency. Having lost their native kingdoms, the people have been
forced to adopt the Arab tribal system, and, unlike the Berbers in
Algiers, have identified themselves enthusiastically with all
things Arab. The more striking is it that they should have still
kept such African customs as the Akh-el-banat, the scarring of the
cheeks, female excision,<a id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> all alien from the true
Arab of Arabia.</p>

<p>If this reading of history be accepted, the people of the
Central Sudan will be described as a mixed race recently forced
into an Arab mould and in varying degrees modified by Arab blood.
And we may prophesy that future researches will prove the other
elements in this race to be akin to the other races on its borders,
to the Nubians and Begas on the north, to the Negroes, Gallas,
Abyssinians, etc., on the south and south-east.</p>

<p>In the above sketch there are so many necessary gaps, and so
many controverted points of necessity passed over in silence, that
it seems fair to the reader to give a brief statement of a
different theory recently put forward by Sir H. H. Johnston on this
subject. We therefore append a <em>rÃ©sumÃ©</em> of his views
compiled by Captain Morant from âThe Nile Questâ:â</p>

<p>In pre-historic times the land on each side of the Red Sea is
said to have joined in the south as well as in the north. By these
necks of land man came to Africa from Asia in the form of dwarfs of
a very low negroid type, resembling the now much-advanced pigmy of
the Congo or the bushman of South Africa. Thus perhaps, say, 10,000
years ago, the Nile basin south of N. latitude 15Â° was peopled by a
negroid species from the east. It seems also not improbable that
Egypt proper and Arabia were within the domains of this negroid
race.</p>

<p>These indigenous pigmies appear to have been at an early date
ousted (say 9,000 years ago) by races of Caucasian stock resembling
the Dravidians of India, of aquiline type, possibly of nearly pure
Caucasian âKhafraâ origin, and probably emanating from Syria,
Cyprus, or Libya.</p>

<p>In Gallaland, Somaliland, and Abyssinia a handsome race of
Caucasian ancestry, mingled no doubt with proto-negroes and
Dravidians, formed originally in Southern Arabia, sprang up. The
lips of this people, destined to become the basis of a
world-renowned and historic type, were full and their noses
straight and finely shaped, whilst their skin was dark and their
hair had a tendency to curl, and like the modern Somali, Galla, or
Danakil, the men grew thin and wedge-shaped beards.</p>

<p>It was by emigrants of this new Hamitic race to the Lower Nile
Basin that the stock of the ruling type of ancient Egyptians was
formed. In the latter, nevertheless, an appreciable amount of Negro
blood from the early Negro population must doubtless have been
absorbed.</p>

<p>So degraded and transformed, however, has been the ancient
Egyptian type by the infusion of the blood of their many successive
rulers, that though facial resemblances may remain, their famous
characteristics have vanished, and the Egyptian of to-day is the
descendant of Slavs and Turks, Arabs, Armenians, and
Circassians.</p>

<p>But it was not only to Egypt that this Hamitic race extended,
but also, though more faint-heartedly, towards the negroid
districts to the south-west to Uganda, Zululand, and even it is
thought to the Atlantic. In Uganda their descendants are now
distinctly traceable.</p>

<p>To recapitulate:âThe country of Ethiopia, which included not
only the highlands of Abyssinia but also the country north, to
Berber or even Dongola, was probably originally populated by a very
low type of pigmy or bushman, then perhaps partially by a race of
big black negroes, such as Shilluk, Dinka, Nuer, and Bari, which in
turn gave way to the Hamitic race already described. The ruling
class of Ethiopia, however (the present âAbyssinianâ in
contradistinction to the âGalla or Somaliâ), became of Semitic
origin through the SabÃ¦an Arab conquest of Abyssinia some 3,000 to
4,000 years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>The break up of
the Israelitish Empire by the Abyssinians and subsequent scattering
of the Jews, many of whom settled in Abyssinia, introduced a
further admixture of Semitic blood.</p>

<p>In comparing this ancient history, much of which is little more
than guesswork, with the state of affairs at the present day, we
find the descendants of the original pigmies, but in a more
advanced state, having been ousted from place to place at length
survive in hiding, as it were, in the forests of the most central
of Central Africa. The big black negro tribes have withdrawn to and
are content to remain in the swampy fever-stricken districts of
which no higher human race has ever yet desired to deprive them.
The Ethiopians have retired before the Arab invaders to their
hills, whilst the Arabs continue to dominate all the country they
cared to conquer.</p>

<p>The Hadendoa, Ababda, Bisharin, Beni Amer, etc., Arabs who speak
a ârotanaâ somewhat resembling the Somali language, are,
undoubtedly, not true Arabs, but are probably descended from the
Hamitic race above described which also was the origin of the
Somali and Galla races.</p>

Greeks, first to grease themselves over and then scrape the skin
with a stone or other scraper. For the Tadkhin, <em>see</em> Baker,

invasions of the Suakin Arabs. Filik, on the Gash, used to be and
is now to a lesser extent a great centre of the Hadendoa tribe. The
Hadendoa are nomads and own large numbers of camels sheep, and
goats, also cattle. They do a little cultivating. They speak a
Rotana similar to that of the Beni Amer and Bisharin, etc., which
is said to be allied to that spoken by the Somalis. They usually
carry very neatly made spears with shafts about 5 feet long bound
at intervals with silver or brass wire, also circular shields about
2 feet 6 inches in circumference made of hippo, buffalo, or giraffe
hide. Like the Bisharin, Beni Amer, Kababish, etc., they wear their
hair in the well-known âfuzzy-wuzzyâ style. The Wililiab are the
leading family of the Hadendoa tribe.</td>

unable to eradicate from their minds the memories of the slave
raids in the time of the old Government. They are expert hunters of
elephants with spears, and great fishermen. They appear to be more
powerful than the other tribes adjoining them, but seem to have
little combination. The Nuer tribal mark consists of six horizontal
lines across the forehead.</td>

the Governor at Kodok. Their number was estimated (1903) at 10,300
males, and 29,000 women and children. In 1903 their cattle was
estimated at 12,200 and their sheep and goats at 63,000. They also
do a good deal of cultivation, and in years of good harvest their
grain is an important factor in the food supply of Omdurman and
